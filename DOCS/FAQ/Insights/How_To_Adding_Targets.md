# How To: Adding Targets

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

In Teamleader Focus, it is possible to set targets on the basis of a number of parameters. Targets can be made for turnover, deals, calls, meetings, tasks and performance. Within each of these types, extra settings can be selected to make the target more specific.

In this article, we'll give you an example of how to set a target. To keep a clear overview, we will only discuss how to set a target for deals because this target contains the most parameters.

 

## Creating a target

*Note: In order to create targets, you need *[*admin rights*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)*.*

 

1. Navigate to the **Insights ****module** 

 

2. Select **Targets** in the submenu. 

 

3. At the top, you will see a "**+**" symbol. Click it. A pop-up menu will be displayed that you can use to define the parameters for the new target.

 

4. Select a **type of target**. In this case, it will be the type "Deals". You will immediately see that several filters have been added. We will discuss these later. At the moment, we will focus on the general filters.

 

5. Your sales process includes different pipelines and phases. Select to which **phase of the deal and to **[**which deal pipeline**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus)** **this target should apply. In this case, we select the "Accepted" phase. This means our target will only filter on deals in this phase. We can also indicate a subtype as a second parameter. Here, it is possible to sort deals by user, source, etc.

 

Let's select '10' as the value target value and set it to a weekly period. 

 

This means we want to achieve 10 accepted offers per week. Under "**Repeat until**" we can select how long we want this target to apply. If we do not enter anything here, the target will be repeated indefinitely.

 

We can also choose whether or not the target will be available to everyone. If we choose not to, only users with admin rights will be able to see the target.

 

## Optional

 

In addition to these standard parameters, there are a few optional filters that might deviate from the type of target you select. For "Deals", we could **select a user to whom the target applies**, or filter based on the **origin of the deal**. Custom fields that apply to deals can also be used for filtering.

We will select the person filter "Samuel Van Daele" and ignore the filter for origin. If we click save, we can see under "Sales phases" that a new target has been created for Samuel Van Daele. 

 

Currently, Samuel's target is red, which means that he does not have enough accepted offers this week to be "on target". The horizontal line on the target indicates the number he should have reached to be on target. If now we set an offer for which Samuel in responsible as "Accepted", we would notice that the target becomes green.

 When the target value is almost reached, the target turns blue.

 

## Details and history

You can also check the progress of the target in detail. 

 

If we click the target, a window showing a graph will open up. To the right of this graph, you will find a box with a date. Under this date, there is a "+" button. If you click this button, an orange line will be added to the graph. This orange line indicates the progress of the previous period of this target.

 

Compare different periods by clicking the arrows next to the dates in the box next to the graph. Click on **Actions** >**Refresh current period**.

This way, we can quickly see how good (or bad) we are doing compared to the same time a week/month/year earlier.

Now that you know how to get started, it's time to set those targets and measure your growth!

 

## Revenue target for quarter

The last subcategory in targets is 'Revenue'. Here, you create a target for your total invoice revenues for each quarter of the current, future or past year. You can do this by clicking on "Settings".

 

The amount shown in' Revenue target for quarter corresponds' to the total excl. VAT of booked invoices of this quarter minus the total excl. VAT of the credit notes of this quarter.

 

You can also calculate it yourself by checking the following segments:
