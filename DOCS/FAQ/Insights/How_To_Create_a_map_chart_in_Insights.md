A map chart allows you to visually see where most of your deals are coming from. By using map charts in Insights, you can identify regions where your business is performing exceptionally well and uncover opportunities for growth in underperforming areas. In this article you’ll learn how to create a map chart in Insights.

- 
You’ll now receive the message that you should start by grouping your data based on location. Add at least one location field to visualise the data e.g. ‘Customer country or 'Customer city':

- 
The map will be generated. You can zoom in on the map to identify the results or you can further refine the results by adding additional filters.

Hover over one of the red pins to view the total amount excl.VAT of the deals in that region. The map will show the first measure field e.g. ‘Amount excl. VAT’ on the chart. Move the fields around in your table to see different metrics. If you move ‘Count’ to the left for example you’ll see the absolute amount of deals in that region on the chart:
