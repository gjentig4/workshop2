Managing projects requires actionable insights into key metrics like profit margin, time spent on projects and overdue invoices. Our project reports centralise this data, helping you identify trends, optimise resources, and improve decision-making. In this article, we explore how these reports boost efficiency and profitability.

# Projects profit margin

Keep track of which projects are returning the highest profit margin.

A profit margin report helps identify the most financially efficient projects, enabling better allocation of resources to maximise profitability.

 

# Projects billing Report

Are your projects getting duly billed? This report gives you an overview of what percentage of the projects' price has been booked. Percentage booked is a ratio of the booked amount to the project total price (exclusive VAT).

 

# Projects time spent

It’s important to keep an overview of whether projects are running within or over their budgeted time.

 

By tracking time spent versus estimated time, you identify projects that are on track, behind schedule, or over budget. This enables you to address potential inefficiencies, allocate resources more effectively, and make informed decisions to prevent delays. Additionally, it offers valuable insights into productivity, workload distribution, and areas where processes may need optimisation. 

 

# Projects overdue invoices

Overview of overdue invoices linked to your projects.

 

# Projects budget spent

It’s important to keep an overview of whether projects are running within or over their allocated budget.

 

# Time Tracking per Project

This report gives a crisp overview of the time tracked per Project, broken down into billable, non-billable, billed and credited hours. Plus the total billable and billed amounts. Deep dive into which work is typically non-billable vs which work gets revenue in.
 

# Time Tracking per Project and User

This report gives a crisp overview of the time tracked per project and a second breakdown by employees participating in the project.
