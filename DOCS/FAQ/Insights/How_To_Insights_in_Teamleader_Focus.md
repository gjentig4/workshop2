Important notes:

- If users don't have [access rights to certain features](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695511139345-How-To-User-permissions-in-Teamleader-Focus) or modules, then that data will be hidden in the reports. E.g. a user without access to Margin on Deals won't be able to see fields related to that feature in a report.

- The data in the reports is synchronised *once a day *(every 24 hours), meaning changes to e.g. quotations/deals/invoices won't be visible immediately.

 

# Customise reports

Of course you’ll also be interested in creating and customising your own reports. This is possible by using the pre-made reports as a starting point! 

- 
**Open a report **by clicking on it in the library e.g. ‘Deals across Phases’:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32451998503569)

You’ll immediately see a chart and the accompanying data in the grid. At the top of the page you’ll find the name of the report, its description and its tags.

*Notes:*

These tags differ from the [tags you can assign to a contact/company](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690854640529-How-To-Using-tags-in-Teamleader-Focus) on CRM level and serve only to assign certain keywords to your report to easily characterise them.

- To completely delete report tags they need to be removed from each report.

 

- Every** report can be configured to match your needs**

 

Customise the name, description and add or remove tags.

- In the **dropdown menu **on the left you get to choose whether you want to visualise the data in either:

A chart and table

- Only a chart

- Only a table
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154338961)

- Next, it’s up to you to choose what data you want to see by selecting the right **group**. Grouping gives you the ability to organise and slice the data through various perspectives e.g group by deal phase or by assignee.
Know that you can also add a second group to further refine your data. In the Deals across Phases report for example, you could group both on deal phase and assignee and even switch the groups, the possibilities are endless.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/31517620630545)

- Next to grouping you can also define to **sort** in ascending or descending order, e.g. to sort within a group.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/36110172753169)

- 
Further refine your report by **adding extra filters**.

In this example, we see a chart and table, grouped by deal phase and filtered on ‘Sales Pipeline’. You could now add an additional filter on e.g. ‘Date added in last year’ and your data is instantaneously adjusted. We visualise the numbers on the chart itself, however hovering over the charts will give you extra information about the numbers:

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/31517940227217)
 

**! PRO TIP: Personalised data via **[**custom fields**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus): in terms of grouping, filtering and visualisation, you can create even more meaningful reports by adding your own custom fields to the reporting. 

Note that custom fields of the types Multiline text and Multiple selection aren't supported and won't show up here.

- New custom fields only show up after a new sync of the insights data (once each day)
 

- In the top right-hand corner of the report, you can select the **type of chart** you want to see:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154355089)

Bar chart

- Line chart

- Pie chart
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006164379025)

- Numeric

- If you’ve chosen to display a **table **in your report, then here are some tips and tricks on how to customise the table further and to specify the information you want to see in the table.

**Drag and drop** certain columns more to the left or the right by clicking and dragging columns elsewhere or go to the **three dots **next to a column name **> Move left/Move right**
**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006164380945)**

- 
**Sort **on a specific column and choose to do this in ascending or descending order.
Do this by hovering over the title of the column and clicking on the up or down arrow, or by clicking on the **three dots > Sort ascending/descending**

- 
**Pin **columns if you want them to take priority on the left-hand side by clicking on the **three dots **next to a column title > **Pin**
Unpin a column by clicking on the pin icon again.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154385681)

- By clicking the **cogwheel on the right** you can choose which information you want to display or hide in the table by enabling or disabling the slider(s).
*![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006164383505)*

You can also add **measurable fields** like ‘Amount excl.VAT, meaning **totals **will be shown at the top of the column, or in this example showing you the total amount of the group namely Amount excl.VAT in the deal phase ‘Accepted’ or ‘Quotation sent’.
*![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006164385041)*

For these fields, you can change the calculation method to either Sum/Average.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/30356483012241)

Tip: you can also add a ‘Count’ column to your overview, making it possible to see totals per group e.g. how many deals are in a certain deal phase.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006164386833)

Tip 2: If you also use a table in combination with a bar chart or pie chart and drag ‘Count’ to the left of the table, this influences the view in the chart as well. Instead of e.g. deal amounts in a certain phase, the number of deals in a certain phase is shown.
 ![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154418321)

 

- 
**Expand **or **collapse **your group to view the information that’s relevant to you by clicking on the arrow in front of the group.
*![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154423569)*

 

- 
**Clickthroughs**: tables have hyperlinks (in blue) that connect everything e.g. in a deal context you could click through to the specific deal page by clicking on the title of the deal. ![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006164393105)

- 
**Adjustable column width**: easily change the width of your insights columns by dragging the column borders left or right.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28212647454353)

 

- 
**Sticky header: **when you have a lot of data in your table it’s interesting to know that the main header is *sticky*, meaning the relevant column titles stay fixed when scrolling down/up in the table.
 

3. Make sure to **save **your report by clicking on **Save as new report **in the top right-hand corner. 

- This way you can easily consult it again whenever the need arises.

- As stated above, you can adapt the title, description and tags, and you can choose to add the report to your favourites.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154428049)
 

4. In the top right-hand corner of a report there's also an 'Export' option to export your report to Excel, CSV or PDF or to copy the link to a report and share it with your colleagues. [Read all about exporting reports here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/32423405276945-FAQ-Can-I-export-the-reports-in-Insights)
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32452037423249)
 

# My reports

The report will show up in **Insights **> **By me **(or if you’ve added it to your favourites, also in ‘Favourites).

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28006154431249)

 

From this report, you can make additional changes by clicking on it, and choose to save the changes to the original report or create a new one from here.

 

**Favourites**

In ‘Favourites’, you can:

- 
**Filter **the reports by **tags **to find them back easily

- 
**Unfavourite **them by clicking on the heart in front of the report name

- Add new reports to your favourites **from your library**

- 
**Customise **the column view

- 
**Delete **a report via the three dots next to it

 

**By me**

In ‘By me’ you can execute the same actions as in Favourites, but additionally you can also **favourite **a report from here by clicking on the heart in front of the report name.

 

! Note that reports are **private **by default so the reports you create won’t be visible for your colleagues.

 

# New vs. old Insights

When you’ve been a customer for quite some time, then you’ll see a combination of our new Insights together with the original statistics in your account.
