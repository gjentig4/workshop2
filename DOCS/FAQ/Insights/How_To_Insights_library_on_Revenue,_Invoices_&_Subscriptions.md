# Invoices

 

## All-in-one revenue report

Get a complete overview of your revenue in one go. See monthly progression in unbilled, billed, paid, unpaid and overdue amounts from Invoices.

## 

Monthly invoiced revenue report

Your monthly revenue based on billed invoices. Consult the number of invoices as well as the revenue.

 

Here, you can easily draw conclusions on which quarter was the most profitable this year.
You can also change the time period to make a comparison with the previous year, for example.
 

## Deals invoiced report

Are your deals getting duly billed? See the percentage of won deals turned into booked invoices. Percentage booked is a ratio of the invoiced amount to the deal total amount (exclusive VAT).

## 

Overdue invoices by Ageing

Distribution of your overdue invoices by Ageing. These invoices need urgent attention as they risk of not getting paid. Make sure to send sufficient reminders.

 

In the context of overdue invoices, ageing is the process of categorising outstanding invoices based on how long they have been unpaid, typically grouped into time periods (e.g., 31-60 days, more than 90 days). This helps businesses track late payments and manage cash flow.

## 

Unpaid invoices per customer

Consult this report to see outstanding invoices per customer. These are not overdue yet, but make sure to send a timely reminder so they get duly paid.

Of course you change the filters and also include the overdue invoices in this view.

## 

Top customers by invoiced amount

Find out which customers are bringing in the most revenue based on billed amount.

 

## Revenue report

Get a clear overview of your revenue based on invoices and credit notes together.

 

## Year-on-Year Revenue

*! This is a premium report that's part of the Advanced insights Booster. *[*Find more information about it here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34775080480913-FAQ-What-are-the-key-features-of-the-Advanced-insights-Booster)
 

Your year-on-year revenue based on invoices and credit notes together in one report

 

# Expenses

*Important tip: if your expenses come in different currencies, the report won't be able to show totals. Filtering on a currency will solve this.*

 

## Monthly expenses report

Get a clear overview of your expenses based on your incoming invoices, incoming credit notes and receipts.

 

## Expenses per supplier

Determine which suppliers are incurring the highest expenses.

 

# Subscriptions
 

## New Subscriptions month-over-month

Keep an overview of the revenue coming through new subscriptions each month.

 

Monitoring new subscriptions monthly offers valuable insights into growth and financial planning, making it easier to adjust and improve approaches for ongoing success.

 

## Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Your MRR report - consult your monthly recurring revenue from subscriptions.

## 

Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

Your ARR report - consult your annual recurring revenue from subscriptions.

 

By analysing ARR, businesses can better forecast revenue, track growth and monitor customer retention. This report is crucial for strategic planning, allowing companies to make informed decisions about budgeting and optimising recurring revenue.
