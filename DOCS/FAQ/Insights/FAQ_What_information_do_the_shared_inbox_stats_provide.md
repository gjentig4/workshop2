![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

The shared inbox is a handy tool that helps you keep an overview of all incoming emails from (potential) customers. Would you like to know how to set up shared inbox statistics? Click [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691088759057-How-To-Using-tickets-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

This article will tell you more about the statistics of shared inbox, available through** Insights**> **Shared inbox**.

 

- At the top of your screen, you always have the option to choose a certain date range:

- When you click the funnel icon at the right-hand side, you can define additional parameters such as users, segments on ticket level and the inbox.

On the left-hand side, you then have different options to choose from:

 

## Created vs Closed

- 
New tickets: Tickets that were created in the selected date range.

- 
Closed tickets: Tickets that were created in the selected date range, and now have the status "closed". The closing date can be situated outside the selected range. However, automatically closed tickets are excluded from this overview.

- 
Unresolved tickets: Tickets that were created in the selected date range and do not have the status "closed".

- 
Autoclosed tickets: Tickets that were created in the selected date range and have been automatically closed. The closing date can be situated outside the selected range.

- 
Reopened tickets: Tickets that were created in the selected date range and changed status from closed to another status.The date of the status change can be situated outside the selected range.

- 
Average replies to close a ticket: the average number of replies (only messages from users, not from customers) to closed tickets that were created during the selected date range. Automatic replies, messages to automatically close tickets and internal notes are not taken into account.

## First response time

An indication of the time between creating a ticket and the first message of a user, for tickets that were created in a selected date range. Automatic replies, messages to automatically close tickets and internal notes are not taken into account.

 

## Average response time

Calculates the average time a user takes to respond to a customer's message for tickets created in the selected date range. Automatic replies, messages to automatically close tickets and internal notes are not taken into account.

 

Note: A response is the first user message following a customer's message. If a user sends two subsequent messages without a customer response in between, only the first message will count as a response.

 

## Full resolution time

Indication of the resolution time for tickets created in the selected data range. The full resolution time is calculated by subtracting the time the ticket was created from the time the ticket was closed.

 

If the ticket was closed by changing its status from "Waiting for customer" to "Closed", as in last status change was from "Waiting for customer" to "Closed", the duration of the status "Waiting for customer" is subtracted from the full resolution time. Note that this only applies to closed tickets.

 

If the ticket hasn't been closed yet, the current time will be used as "close time". This means that unresolved tickets will also appear in the graph.

 

## Busiest time of the day

This overview shows the new tickets and incoming messages in a heat map split up in days and time slots. If the selected date range comprises more than one week, an average will be calculated per slot.

 

In order to keep a structured overview, the selected date range will always be rounded to a plurality of 7, e.g. If you select a range of 10 days, the range will be rounded to 14 days.

 

- 
New tickets: Shows tickets that have been created in the selected date range.

- 
Incoming messages: Shows received messages from customers during the selected date range. The ticket does not have to be created during the selected date range.

 

## Ticket distribution

Unlike the other options, you cannot select a date range but only a specific point in time. You will then see the tickets, the responsible person and the status of the ticket at the selected moment. You can also choose to group them by user or by status.

 

## Individual performance

You will see all the replies sent during the selected date range distributed over the different users.

 

The average response time per user will also be calculated.

 

Note: A response is the first user message following a customer's message. If a user sends subsequent messages without a customer reply in between, only the first message will count as a response. Automatic replies, messages to automatically close tickets and internal notes are not taken into account.

 

## Top 25 customers

Here, an overview of the 25 customers who created most tickets during a selected date range will be displayed. Customers can consist of companies or contacts.

 

## Duration open tickets

This option shows unresolved (=not closed) tickets which were created during the selected date range. Tickets are split into categories and subcategories based on duration and status.

 

The duration of a ticket is calculated by subtracting the time of the creation and the duration the ticket was closed from the current time. This means that if a ticket was reopened at some point, the time it was closed will not be taken into account.
