# FAQ: What are the different rights in a project?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691918360081)

 

In Teamleader Focus, there are two levels to define the rights within a project. You can either limit the access to projects or you can assign different roles within a project.

 

## Access rights to projects

- Navigate to "**Settings**" > "**HR**"

- Click on the **pencil **next to a co-workers name. Note that this colleague cannot be an admin in your Teamleader Focus account. The rights of admins cannot be restricted.

- In case the toggle next to "**Projects**" is on "**Yes**", you see a dropdown menu directly under it next to "**Access**"

- Choose what access rights this user should have: 

Access to all projects: This colleague can see all projects.

- According to participation: This colleague can only see the projects of which he/she is participant or decision maker.

- Admin access to all projects: This colleague has access to all projects with the rights of a decision maker.

- The **Profit on Projects** toggle allows you to deactivate access to the [Profit function](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693364328465-How-To-Calculate-profit-on-your-projects) in a project.

- The **External costs **toggle allows you to activate or deactivate access to the [external costs in a project](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691673649681-How-To-Managing-external-costs-of-a-project).

 

## Roles within a project

Within every project, you have two different kinds of roles:

 

Decision maker: The decision maker has access to all details of the project, he/she can edit the budget spent and the invoices.

 

Participant: can see the phases, external costs (if the toggle in **Settings > HR **is activated) and the attached time tracking but cannot edit them.

 

You can decide who can access the external costs of a project by navigating to **Settings **> **Projects **> **Preferences **> **Limit access to financial information on projects**. 

 

In case you do not want to show the external costs to your employees, you do not only need to set this preference to "Yes", you also need to remove their access to invoices. Check [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691605666193-FAQ-Why-do-I-not-have-the-same-features-in-my-Teamleader-Focus-account-as-my-colleague) for more information. 

- If a participant has access to external costs, and to invoices = he or she can see all external costs

- If a participant has access to external costs, but not to invoices = he or she can only see his/her own external costs

 

In case you do want to show the external costs to your employees, you need to set this preference to "No":

- If a participant has access to external costs, and to invoices = he or she can see all external costs 

- If a participant has access to external costs, but not to invoices = he or she can still see all external costs

 

[Read this article to learn more on budget management on projects and who has access to 'budget spent'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693457215889-How-To-Budget-management-on-projects)

In order to see which participant has which role, you follow those steps:

- Navigate to the project in question

- Click on the tab **Project info **in the header and scroll down to "Co-workers"

- You see either "Participant" or "Decision maker" below the names of the collaborating colleagues. You also have the choice between those two roles whenever you add a new colleague to a project.

 

**General notes**

- The colleague the project is assigned to is automatically a decision maker

- The colleague a phase is assigned to will be a participant by default. However, he/she will still be responsible for the assigned phase.

- Both decision makers and participants can[ track time](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) for a project. Only the admins will be able to edit this time tracking.

- Projects can only be deleted by a user with [admin rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) in Teamleader Focus.
