# FAQ: What do the colors under project progress stand for?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

Within every project, there is a **Project info **tab in the header. Click on it to find the "Progress" section with the subcategory "Roadmap". This article explains the color coding used in that roadmap.

Red: The deadline has passed but the phase hasn't been closed yet.

Blue: The deadline hasn't passed, and the phase hasn't been closed yet.

Green: The phase has been closed.

### 'Phase' in your project overview

When you return to the general overview of your projects, you can also add the column 'phase' to that overview via the cogwheel in the bottom right-hand corner. If the colour of your phase turns orange, then it means that the due date of your active phase has passed.
