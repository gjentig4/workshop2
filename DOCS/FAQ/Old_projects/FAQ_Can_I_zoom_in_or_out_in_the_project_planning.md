# FAQ: Can I zoom in or out in the project planning?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

Yes, you can. When entering the project planning, you can see the weeks that are displayed on the screen. Use the plus and minus buttons to zoom in or out and get more or less weeks on your screen.

You can zoom in to a maximum of 1 week and zoom out to a maximum of 8 weeks.

So now, as a project planner, you're able to zoom in and out on running projects, being able to see where you need more resources or more time in order to lead the project towards a happy end for you, your team and your customer.
