# How To: Budget management on projects: Use cases

[Budget management on projects](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25693457215889) is a way to keep track of the predetermined budget you and your customer have agreed upon. By allocating resources and estimating time on tasks & meetings, you'll know if you are going over budget. This way you can communicate transparently with your customer so both parties remain happy. This article focuses on some use cases based on a different billing method of your phases in the project.

If you want to learn more about what budget spent means on a project, [we advise you to read this article](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25693457215889).

# Example 1: Billing method of phases is based on ‘fixed price’

- Create a project with the invoicing preferences based on ‘price per user’

- Fill out a budget for the project e.g. €5000.

- 
Create 2 phases with ‘fixed price’ as billing method

Phase 1 = €3000 budget

- Phase 2 = €2000 budget

- Navigate to the tab **Project info **in the header of your project. You'll find the widget 'Budget' spent here.![Project budget and profit tracking dashboard showing budget spent and profit margins.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697559570449)

- The budget spent will be €0,00 / €5000 for the complete project. The profit will already be €5000 because you are working with a fixed price/billable amount of €5000.

- 
Add a task to the first phase with a duration of 3 hours. 

Track time for 2 hours on the task.

- Add an external cost of €3000 (sale price of the product) to the second phase.

- The forecast bar and the tab ‘phase budgets’ will show the following:![Project phase budget forecast table showing spent vs. provided amounts and budget status.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697559631889)

- Forecast for Phase 1 displays €600 because task duration (3h) * external hourly rate user (€200)

- Spent budget for Phase 1 is €400 because you tracked 2 hours of time: task duration (2h) * external hourly rate user (€200)

- Spent budget for Phase 2 displays €3000 while the provided budget is €2000, this phase is over budget (in red).

- 
In total however you’ve only spent €3400 / €5000 budget, so the budget usage is on track.

The profit will be €4860 because of the costs (€140) you’ve made (internal cost of the user (€70) that tracked 2 hours of time).![Project financial overview showing budget spent, profit margin, and time tracked.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697559696785)

# Example 2: Billing method of phases is based on ‘time and material’

- Create a project with the invoicing preferences based on ‘price per user’

- Fill out a budget for the project e.g. €5 000.

- 
Create 3 phases with ‘time & material’ as billing method:

First phase with €1 000 budget

- Second phase with €1 500 budget

- Third phase with €2 500 budget

- 
Add tasks to the phases:

Add a task to the first phase with a duration of 5 hours.

- Add a task to the second phase with a duration of 10 hours.

- Add task to the third phase with a duration of 15 hours.

- 
Track time on the tasks:

First phase: track 4 hours time of the provided 5 hours.

- Second phase: track 7 hours of the provided 10 hours.

- Third phase: track 20 hours of the provided 15 hours.

- 
You’ll find the following budget spent overview on your **Project info **page:![Project budget tracking dashboard showing budget spent, profit, and time tracked per phase.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697611770385)

- 
Phase 1 is on track (green) because it won’t go over budget: 

€800 is already spent because 4 hours were tracked (external cost of €200 * 4 hours)

- 1 hour of time tracking (€200) is still remaining

- Forecast €1000: €800 spent + €200 forecasted

- 
Phase 2 is at risk (yellow) because it will go over budget if the remaining hours of the task are tracked:

€1400 is already spent because 7 hours were tracked (external cost of €200 * 7 hours) 

- 3 hours of time tracking remaining (€600).

- Forecast €2000: €1400 spent + €600 forecasted

- 
Phase 3 is already over budget (red):

€4000 is already spent because 20 hours were tracked (external cost of €200 * 20 hours)

- 5 hours more time tracking was done (€1000): 20 hours instead of the task duration of 15 hours 

- 
Forecast €4000: €1500 more than provided (€2500) was spent. 

Light red colour = €2500 was provided but with task duration of 15 hours the phase was already at risk to go over budget to begin with: €200 (external cost) * 15 (hours) = €3000

- 
Darker red colour = the extra €1000 euro spent because of the 5 hours time tracking
