# How To: How can I close a project?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691001072017)

When a project is over and done with, you'll want to classify it as such. Not sure how to close a project? You’ve come to the right page. The ways to close a project in Teamleader Focus will be described here. 

## Via your project

There are two ways to close a project via your project page.

The first way to close a project is closing it directly from the project page:

- Navigate to your project

- Click on the **three dots **next to your project details

- Choose **Close project**

*Notes: *

- Closing a project will also close all phases and mark their tasks as done. Meetings will remain open until manually marked as done.

- It's also possible to close projects **in bulk **by navigating to the overview of your projects and creating a segment there. Next, you choose '**Close projects' **and the projects you are allowed to close will be closed.

The second way to close a project is by closing all phases of your project:

- Regardless of any open task that is linked to the project, when the phases linked to a project are marked as done, the project will be marked as ‘done’ as well. 

- Navigate to the [work breakdown](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25697800978065) page of your project, hover over a phase and choose **Close phase: ****![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691013880849)**

- When every phase in a project is set to ‘Closed’, the project will be considered completed.

## Via the cross-projects timeline

You can close a project via your [cross-projects timeline](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25693534082449) by following these steps:

- Click on the **project**

- Click on **Details**

- Click on the **arrow **next to 'Hide on timeline'

- Click on **Close project **![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691003348497)

## Via the project planning

(*This feature is available in our *[*Boost *](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25697618837009)*package)*

You can also close a project via the [project planning](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25692090129937). Note that you can only do this when you have [admin access to all projects](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25691912071825). Follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Projects > Planning**

- Look for your project in the list

- Click on the grey line next to the corresponding project:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691001192337)

- Next, click on **Mark project as completed**:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690990502801)

- This will close all phases and related tasks.

## Reopen a project

There are two ways to reopen a project:

- Reopen it directly from the project page:

Navigate to your project

- At the top of your project, you'll see a banner stating the project has been closed. Click on **Reopen this project.**

- Reopen the project by opening a phase of the project

Navigate to your project

- Go to the work breakdown of your project

- Click on the phase you want to reopen and choose **Reopen**

- The project will automatically be reopened

**Important note: reopening a project won't reopen the linked tasks or the meetings you manually marked as done. You'll need to reopen these manually if needed.**
