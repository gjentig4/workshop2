# FAQ: Can I copy a project in Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

You cannot directly copy a project but you can save a project as template.

## How can I create a project template?

- Go to the project you would like to copy and go to the **Project info **tab. Click on the three dots at the very top of the page. Now choose “Save as template”.

- You then get to see a pop-up:

- Assign a name. 

- Choose to include tasks or not. If you don't include the tasks, phases will still be saved without the connected tasks. 

Important notes:

- The project you used as a template should not be changed anymore. If you edit the original project, your templates will change accordingly. Older projects created from the same template will not be affected by this.

- The tasks within the template project will also appear on the dashboard of you and your colleagues. To avoid this, you need to finish these tasks once. However, do not delete the tasks as they then would also be deleted from the template.

**Therefore, we highly discourage to use the template project as a regular project.**

## How can I use a project template?

When you start a new project, you can now select the template you've created.![The 'Add Project' dialog box in Teamleader Focus showing project details and template selection.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691250347921)

### What will be copied from the template to the new project?

- The names of the phases

- The time frame of the phases. That means that the time in between and corresponding dependencies will be copied. After you've chosen a start date or an end-date, the phases will be created accordingly.![The 'Add Project' dialog in Teamleader Focus showing project template and planning options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691234177041)

- Budget distribution on the different phases
Imagine the total budget of your project is €1000, with the budget of the first phase €400 and the second phase €600. If you create a template of this project and use it to create a new project of for example €400 total budget, the budget distribution on the different phases will also be 40-60. It will be distributed to €160 and €240 in this case.

- Invoice preferences of the phases

- Tasks (depending on your choice): 

The task responsible remains the same as in the original template project. In case you prefer to have one responsible for all tasks, who then distributes the tasks as a second step, then you'll have to create a project with all tasks linked to that user and create a template out of the project.

- The due date of the tasks takes over the deadline of the phase. If your phase is due at the end of the month, your tasks will be too.

## Can I change my project template?

## Can I delete a project template?

In case you want to delete a project template, then you go to **Settings **> **Projects **> **Project ****templates **and click on the small bin next to the templates you would like to delete.

This has no influence on the already existing projects that you've made with the same template.
