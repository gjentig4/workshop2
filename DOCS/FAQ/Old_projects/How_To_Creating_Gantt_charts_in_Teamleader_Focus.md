# How To: Creating Gantt charts in Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693025771793)

****

With Teamleader Focus, you can [split up projects into bigger phases and smaller tasks](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25697800978065). Phases are represented on a roadmap, but you can check all linked tasks in a downloadable Gantt chart. 

To create a Gantt chart:

- Navigate to your project

- Make sure you have a few different phases with linked tasks

- Click on the **Project info **tab in the header

- Go to 'Progress'

- Click on **Gantt chart ****![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693013968273)**

- A .png file will be generated showing you an overview of:

the start date of the project 

- the end date of the project

- phases with linked tasks

- green dot = closed phase(s)

- blue dot = unfinished but still on time phase(s)

- red dot = unfinished and overdue phase(s)

- blue bar = open tasks that are still on time

- green bar = finished tasks

- red bar = open but overdue tasks![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693034304273)

If you’d like to know more about the remaining time and how much time you should still have in an ideal scenario, you can always have a look at a burndown.

Another feature that comes in handy are [project reports](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25691716494225). They give you a detailed overview of planned and spent budgets, how much time each co-worker tracked on tasks and meetings, and the products that were ordered. This information is really useful to improve time and budget estimates, which helps you create stronger Gantt charts.
