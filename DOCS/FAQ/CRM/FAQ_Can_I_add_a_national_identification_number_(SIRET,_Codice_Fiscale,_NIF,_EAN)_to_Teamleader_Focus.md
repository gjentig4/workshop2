# FAQ: Can I add a national identification number (SIRET, Codice Fiscale, NIF, EAN) to Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692961270417)

Some European countries have specific business numbers besides the acknowledged European VAT number. We've provided the fields below for companies or contacts residing in these countries:

- 
**SIRET-number** for French companies 

- 
**Codice Fiscale** for Italian contacts and companies

- 
**NIF number** for Spanish contacts and companies 

- 
**EAN numbe**r for Danish companies 

You can also use these fields for in your Teamleader Focus account. For example, if your own company is located in Spain, you will be able to fill in your own NIF number. If your company is located in France, you can insert your own SIRET-number.

These national identification number fields will also be available for all outgoing documents. Simply place the shortcodes $CLIENT_NATIONAL_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER$ and $DEPARTMENT_NATIONAL_IDENTIFICATION_NUMBER$ on your templates!
