Everything in Teamleader Focus starts with your CRM. Moving forward, all deals, meetings, tasks, calls, projects, tickets etc. will be linked to a specific company and or contact. So one of the first steps when you get started is to set up your CRM. In this article you will learn about the different ways to add companies. Also looking to add contacts? [This article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691553397137-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-contact-in-Teamleader-Focus) will tell you all about it.

- Adding companies manually

- Adding companies via import

- Adding companies via Trends Top integration (only for Belgium)

 

## 1. Adding companies manually

- The first possibility is to add companies one by one. Go to **Companies **and click on **Add company **or click the plus sign in the top right hand corner and select ‘Add company’.

- This pop-up will then appear:
![The 'Add company' dialog box in Teamleader Focus with fields for contact and industry information.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691984792465)

- You can now start adding information. Note that only ‘Company name’ is a required field, which is indicated by the red asterisk. In [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691611839633-FAQ-Can-you-make-fields-required-in-Teamleader-Focus), you can find out how to add required fields. 

- In the field Company lookup, the VAT (Europe, via the [VIES platform](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/#/vat-validation)), KVK (the Netherlands) or SIRET (France) number can be filled out to activate an autofill of company details like company name and address. [Read this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693332190737-FAQ-What-if-the-VAT-KVK-or-SIRET-autofill-doesn-t-work) if the autofill doesn't work.

- You have the option to add an invoicing, delivery and visiting addresses by clicking on **+ Add another address**. Note that the primary address is mandatory if you want to start adding extra addresses.

- The sector field is based on the list used by Trends ([the sector field list is attached at the end of this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/article_attachments/32451197058577)). If you prefer to use your own sectors however, you can create a custom field. You can use these custom fields to add any extra information you may want. Don’t know what those are yet? No problem, [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus) provides answers to all your questions.

## 3. Adding companies via Trends Top integration (only for Belgium)

 

If you have a Trends Top account, you can integrate your Trends Top data with Teamleader Focus. If you have a Trends Top account with export rights, i.e. the Marketing or Business formula (see [website](https://trendstop.knack.be/en/trendstop-pricing.aspx?int_campaign=direct&int_content=nav-right)), you don't need to pay twice for the same data. 

 

1. Click your profile picture or the logo in the top right-hand corner and select ‘[Integrations](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/eu/en)’:

 

2. Scroll down to ‘Accounting and finances’ and select TrendsTop. Switch the slider to YES and fill in your username and password.

 

3. Whenever you add a new company via **Add company** and fill in the VAT number, Teamleader Focus will automatically complete the entry with further info on this company from Trends Top. Once you’ve added a company, you will also see a ‘Trends Top’ button:
