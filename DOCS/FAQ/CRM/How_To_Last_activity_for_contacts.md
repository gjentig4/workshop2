# How To: Last activity for contacts

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697765294737)

If you want to see which contacts need some attention, you can check the 'last activity' date. 
It's possible to add this column to the overview of all your contacts (your contacts list), but on individual contact pages you'll have to scroll down to 'Activities' to see the history.

 

The column "Last activity" on the contact overview page updates when you:

- add a note to the activities on the contact page

- finish a call

- finish a task

- finish a meeting linked to this contact

- send an email or track a sent mail

- create an invoice

- send an invoice

- create a project 

- create a meeting for a project for this contact

 

This field doesn't update however when you:

- create a deal for this contact

- create a call for this contact

- create a task for this contact

- create a meeting for this contact that isn't linked to a project
