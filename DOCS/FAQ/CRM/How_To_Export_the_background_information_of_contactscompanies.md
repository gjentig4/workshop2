When adding a contact or a company in Teamleader Focus, you can also add background information that might come in handy when you need to contact a customer. To add this, open a contact or company page and click on the **pencil** next to Background information or click on **+ Add background information**.![Company information and background information widgets in a Teamleader Focus CRM company profile.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693481645329)

If you want to export this background information when exporting companies or contacts from Teamleader Focus, you probably already noticed that they are not exported by default. 

 

In order to export the background information, you will have to create an [export template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25698010805521-FAQ-How-can-I-select-the-fields-that-need-to-be-exported) by following these steps:

- 
Go to Contacts/Companies and click on **Export**

- 
Click on the **arrow** next to Basic columns >** Create new template**

- 
Select the values you want to export by double-clicking or by selecting the values and clicking on the **arrow **pointing to the right to add it to the selected columns list. To export the background information, chose the value ‘Background information’![The Excel Export Template configuration screen in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693518010257)

- 
Add a template name

- 
Click on **Save**

- 
Click on Start **export**

 

**Notes:**

- 
Make sure you have [export rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691580510609-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-see-the-export-button) in Teamleader Focus. To grant someone export rights, the administrator will need to navigate to **Settings > Users > click on the name of a user > **'Permissions' > 'General' > enable the slider **Export.**

- 
The background information will be exported in html code.

- As the background information is more internal information there is no separate shortcode for it to e.g. put it on the template of an invoice. If you need to add extra information on your invoice though you can add it to the 'remarks' of your invoice and [add the shortcode $COMMENTS$ to your invoice template.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692647207057-How-To-Customizing-your-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus)
