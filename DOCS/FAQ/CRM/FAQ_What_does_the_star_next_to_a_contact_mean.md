# FAQ: What does the star next to a contact mean?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

When you navigate to Companies > Related contacts, you'll see a star icon next to your contact's name.

![The 'Related contacts' section on a company page in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692671733393)

 

 

 

When this star is ticked, this contact will be marked as decision maker for that particular company. This helps you determine who to contact in case any critical questions arise.

 

Determining who the decision maker is, is also important when you send out an invoice. More information on this can be found in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692222317201-How-To-How-can-I-set-whom-the-invoices-are-emailed-to).
