# FAQ: How can I add account managers in Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

In Teamleader Focus, you can add account managers or assign a responsible colleague in different ways. Account managers can help you define responsibilities, distribute work and stay up to date.

 

You can also create [segments](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus) for account managers to keep an overview and to know exactly who is responsible for what.

 

## Company and deals

- Navigate to "**Companies**" or "**Deals**"

- Choose "**Account manager**" on company level and "**Assigned to**" on deal level

- Choose the respective colleague from the list of users

Notes:

- You can choose to define an account manager for companies, but defining an account manager for deals is mandatory.

- Account managers of companies and deals will be notified when actions are taken that involve the company or the deal.

- Based on the account managers of [companies](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692271859857-FAQ-What-does-limited-CRM-access-stand-for) and [deals](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691455806993-FAQ-What-does-limited-deal-access-mean), you can limit access via **Settings **> **Users **(limited CRM and limited deal access).

- You have the option to add a second account manager to a company or a deal. To do so, simply [send an email to our support team, so they can activate this feature for you](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065). Once activated this new field will be visible on all contacts and companies. Account managers will then receive notifications whenever the company or deal is updated.

- A second account manager can also prove useful if you want to limit CRM access or deal access for your co-workers. You can then define two colleagues that will have access to a company or deal by making them account managers.

 

## Contacts and invoices

There is no account manager defined by default but you can add an account manager manually for contacts or invoices. 

- Navigate to **Settings** > **Custom fields**

- Add a custom field of type "User" on the desired level.

Note:

You cannot use this field to restrict access rights, but you can define a user as responsible and segment based on that custom field.
