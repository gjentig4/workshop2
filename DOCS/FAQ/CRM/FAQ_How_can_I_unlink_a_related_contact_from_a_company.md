Did your contact stop working for a certain company? You can unlink the contact very easily. To do so, go to **Companies** > open the company > scroll down to the related contact > click on the **three ****dots **> **Unlink**.

Deleting this contact does not mean that you delete it from your CRM, it only means that you delete the link between the contact and the company.
