In case you accidentally created a contact or a company twice, you always have the possibility to merge two contacts or companies.

**Notes:** 

- You cannot undo the action of merging a contact or company. So be sure to double check if you really want to merge two contacts or companies. 

- The example below is based on contacts, but merging companies is done in the same way. 

## Merging contacts

1. To merge two contacts, go to the detail page of one of them via **Contacts**. Click on the **three dots **at the very top next to “Contact information”.![Contact information card in Teamleader Focus with the actions dropdown menu open.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691769394705)

2. Select “**Merge contact**” which brings you to the screen below. Fill in the second contact - the other contact you would like to merge.

3. If your database contains a contact with a similar name, Teamleader Focus will ask you if you want to merge these two contacts. You can always select another contact to merge with.

4. Once you click “**Do now**”, you will be taken to the screen below, if the data for both contacts doesn't match exactly.
