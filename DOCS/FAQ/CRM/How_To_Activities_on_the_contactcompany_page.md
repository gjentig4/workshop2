You can always follow up on the latest information regarding your contact or company in Teamleader Focus. Read this article to learn all about the ‘Activities’ on your contact/company page.

 

## What

Basically, the ‘Activities’ on a contact or company page display a history of everything that happened for this contact/company. Some examples:

- 
Notes that were added

You or your colleagues can easily add notes to a contact/company by clicking the **+ Add note** button in Activities. Mention a colleague by adding the @-sign, choose if this message links to a deal or choose the type of message, e.g. a note.

- 
Files that were added/edited

- 
Emails sent/received

- 
Deal activity, e.g.:

Probability changes

- 
Deal phase changes

- 
Quotations sent, viewed and accepted

- 
Invoices activity

- 
Time tracking added

- 
Tasks, meetings or calls that were added/marked as done

- 
Project activity

- 
Ticket interaction

 

## Filter

Imagine you have a lot of interaction for a certain company and you’re only looking for the invoice activity, then you can easily select this type of activity and exclude the others. 

- Click on the **arrow **next to ‘Show all’ and choose your type:
