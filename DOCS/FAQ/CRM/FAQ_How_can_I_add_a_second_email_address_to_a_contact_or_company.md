# FAQ: How can I add a second email address to a contact or company?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

Teamleader has the option to add one email address for every contact and company by default. But what if you have a contact that works for two companies and has a different email address for every company? In that case you can easily add a second one following the next steps:

 

1. Go to **Settings** > **Custom Fields**. 

 

2. Click on the plus sign to add a new custom field and complete as follows:
![The 'Add Custom field' dialog box in Teamleader Focus settings.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691904849297)

In the example above we created a field on contact level, but you can also select for 'Company' to create a field on company level. 

 

3. Click **S****ave **and add a new contact. You will see that Teamleader Focus added a second email field under the first one:

Note: If you want to add more addresses, you can simply repeat the steps explained above.

 

# Can be used for

The second email address can be used for the following scenarios:

- As mentioned above, this extra field comes in handy for keeping all contact information in one place.

- Moreover, the custom field can be synced to [Mailchimp](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690774879889-How-To-Send-email-campaigns-with-Mailchimp-in-Teamleader-Focus) or [Campaign Monitor ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690737500305-How-To-Sending-email-campaign-with-Campaign-Monitor-in-Teamleader-Focus)for use in mailings.

- When sending a quotation, you can manually change the 'To' email address to use the one from the custom field.
 

# Can't be used for

The second email address can't be used for the following scenarios:

- When creating a ticket, you can only send this to the primary email address of your contact, not to custom field emails.

- Email tracking (plugins/IMAP) only recognises the standard email field, not custom field email addresses. If you want to track emails on multiple addresses, you need to use [BCC tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692591287697-How-To-Tracking-emails-to-Teamleader-Focus#:~:text=store%20the%20email-,Sending%20email%20in%20bcc,-Every%20Teamleader%20Focus).

- For invoicing purposes, you should use the [invoicing preferences on company level instead](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692222317201-How-To-How-can-I-set-whom-the-invoices-are-emailed-to), where you can add multiple invoice email addresses that will be used automatically.
