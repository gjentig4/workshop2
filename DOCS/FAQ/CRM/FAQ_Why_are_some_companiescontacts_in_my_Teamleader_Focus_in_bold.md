# FAQ: Why are some companies/contacts in my Teamleader Focus in bold?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

In the overview, newly added companies or contacts are always in bold. For the first 24 hours, that is how Teamleader Focus indicates that there has been a new addition to the database.

This indication is on user level, which means in case you log in after a few days of having been inactive, all contacts or companies which have been added since your last log-in are marked as new.
