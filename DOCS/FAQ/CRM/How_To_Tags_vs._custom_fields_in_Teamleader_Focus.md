# How To: Tags vs. custom fields in Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/37676773258641)
When working with data in Teamleader Focus, organising your contacts and companies effectively is key to getting the most out of the tool. Two common ways to structure and categorise your data are tags and custom fields. While they may appear similar at first, they serve different purposes. Choosing one over the other has consequences for segmentation, reporting, document display, and integrations. Read more here!
 

# **What are tags?**

**Tags** are labels you can apply to **contacts and companies** to group them based on shared characteristics. Think of them as informal categories or keywords.
 

## **Characteristics of tags:**

✅ Used **only** for contacts and companies
 

✅ **Created once** and then re-used across both contacts and companies
 

✅ **Clearly visible** in the contact or company detail page
 

✅ You can assign **multiple tags** to one contact/company
 

✅ You can **bulk add or remove** tags
 

✅ You can create **segments** based on tags
 

🔴 **Not exportable to **[**Mailchimp**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690774879889-How-To-Send-email-campaigns-with-Mailchimp-in-Teamleader-Focus)** or **[**Campaign Monitor**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690737500305-How-To-Sending-email-campaign-with-Campaign-Monitor-in-Teamleader-Focus)
 

🔴 **Not displayable** on document layouts like quotations or invoices
 

## **When to use tags**

Use tags for **quick categorisation or temporary grouping** — for example, tagging clients that attended an event, marking "VIP" customers, or making a difference between prospects vs. customers vs. suppliers. Tags are flexible and easy to apply in bulk, but less structured.
 

# **What are custom fields?**

**Custom fields** allow you to store **structured data** on different record types such as contacts, companies, deals, invoices, and more.
 

## **Characteristics of custom fields:**

✅ Can be created for **any type of item**, not just contacts or companies
 

🔁 If you want the same field on contacts *and* companies, you must **create it twice**
 

✅ Various **field types** available: text, dropdown, checkbox, date, etc.
 

✅ You can create **segments** based on custom field values
 

✅ **Exportable to **[**Mailchimp **](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690774879889-How-To-Send-email-campaigns-with-Mailchimp-in-Teamleader-Focus)**or **[**Campaign Monitor**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690737500305-How-To-Sending-email-campaign-with-Campaign-Monitor-in-Teamleader-Focus)
 

✅ **Visible on document layouts** like quotations and invoices
 

✅ Custom fields are **usable in insights to filter on**
 

⚠️ **Maximum of 25 or 50 custom fields** per type
 

## **When to use custom fields**

Use custom fields when you need **structured, reportable data**. For example: a dropdown for customer type (partner, reseller, end-user), a date field for contract renewal, or a checkbox for GDPR consent.
 

# **Which one should you use?**

- Do I need a **quick way to categorise** and filter contacts/companies without needing structured data? → **Use tags**
 

- Do I need to **store structured data**, **include it in documents**, or **export it** to tools like Mailchimp? → **Use custom fields**
 

In practice, many users benefit from using **both** — tags for flexible categorisation, and custom fields for when precision and structure matter.
