A tag is a nifty way to add a certain characteristic to contacts or companies. Doing this allows you to easily divide them into categories: when creating a segment, you can filter based on your own created tags.

Examples of tags can be ‘Customer’, ‘Supplier’, ‘Prospect’, but as with the segments, you’re only limited by your imagination!

- A tag is an eye catcher: you can spot them immediately on a contact or company detail page.

- Just make sure that you don’t put too much information in a tag, as it can get messy real quick.

- A contact or company can have multiple tags and can be used to create different segments.

## Creating tags

- Navigate to “**Settings**” and click “**CRM**”

- Click on the “**+**” symbol next to “Tags”

- Give your newly created tag a name

- Click “**Save**”

- Now you can assign the tag to a contact or company.

## Assigning tags 

- Go to “**Contacts**” or “**Company**”

- Choose a company and click on the **pencil **next to “Company information”

- In the pop up screen you can choose a tag from the drop down menu next to “Tags”![The Tags dropdown menu within the Industry section of a contact or company form.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690853905681)

- 
Click on **Save**

 

## Removing tags

- Go to a company or a contact
