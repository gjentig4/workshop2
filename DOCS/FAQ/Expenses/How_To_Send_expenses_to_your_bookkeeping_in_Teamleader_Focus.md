Fill out a bookkeeping tool email address and select a company entity. Know that you can pick [multiple company entities](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) for the same email address.
Note: if there's an expense 

- 'Auto sync to bookkeeping tool': you can set this to 'When approved'. In this case, your expenses will be automatically sent to your bookkeeping tool email after 1 hour, if they are approved and were not sent before. Note that this will start working for new expenses that meet that condition, but there is no historic sending.

- 
**Confirm** that this is your bookkeeping tool email address.

- Click on **Save.**

- After you’ve added an email address, you’ll receive the following message stating that your expenses will be sent from this ‘from’ email address. Add this address as an allowed sender in your bookkeeping tool, as lots of bookkeeping tools block external email addresses.

- If you haven't auto synced your expenses to your bookkeeping tool, return to the expense you want to send and click on the button **Send to bookkeeper.**
**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34358787903889)**

Review the email address and click on **Send.**
 

- The email itself will have no content (body) except for the file in attachment. If it’s an invoice via Peppol, the attachment will be a UBL file, otherwise it’s a PDF file.

- Afterwards, you’ll be able to resend the document but we will give you a warning you’ve already sent it.
 

- The ‘Bookkeeping status’ in the header of your expense will have changed to ‘Sent’.
*Notes:*

If sending failed the status will change to ‘Failed’ and you’ll also receive an in-app notification and an email informing you of this.

- If you’ve sent the expense to several email addresses but only one successfully arrived then we’ll still mark the status as ‘Sent’.
 

- In the ‘Details’ tab of your expense you’ll find the activity feed at the bottom was updated as well.

- If auto syncing of approved expenses is off, know that you can also send your expenses in bulk to your bookkeeper by selecting them.
