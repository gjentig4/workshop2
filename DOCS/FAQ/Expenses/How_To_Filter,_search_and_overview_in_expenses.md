There are some **bulk actions on expenses** you can execute, like changing the status of your expenses in bulk, send your expenses to the bookkeeper, mark them as paid or delete them. Select the boxes next to your expenses in your overview and you'll see these options:

- Mark as approved

- Send to bookkeeper

- Mark as paid

- Mark as refused

- Mark as pending

- Delete

In the overview of your expenses you can **search **on:

- The document number;

- The title of the expense;

- The supplier of the expense. 
*Know that we don’t distinguish between regular contacts/companies or suppliers in your account, so if you want to specifically search on expenses per supplier you can always do that here.*
 

Create a **filter **based on the following fields to easily find the information you’re looking for:

- Expense type

- Date

- Review status

- Bookkeeping status

- [Payment status](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/39152238003345-How-To-Add-payments-to-expenses-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Date paid

- Supplier

- Company entity
 

The filter you selected will be remembered for next time you visit the expenses overview page.
