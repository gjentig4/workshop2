Want a better grip on your expenses? With payment tracking in Teamleader Focus, you’ll always know which expenses are paid, partially paid, or still outstanding.

# 

Mark an expense as paid

All users (admins and non-admins) can add payments to any type of expense: incoming invoices, credit notes, or receipts. Follow these steps to add a payment to an expense:

- Navigate to your expense

- Click **Add payment** in the top right-hand corner, or go to the **Payments** tab > **Linked payments** > **Add payment**.

*Notes:*

If your expense isn’t approved yet, you can find the option to add a payment if you click on the arrow next to ‘Mark as approved’.
![Action buttons for approving, refusing, or adding payments to a document in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/39164417083025)

- You can also add a payment to expenses that are refused or pending, if needed.

- You can’t add a payment to expenses without a total amount including VAT. Edit the expense and fill in the total first.
![Approval and payment options for an expense in Teamleader Focus with a validation tooltip.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/39164370634001)
 

- A pop-up opens in which you can add the details of your payment.
![The 'Add payment' dialog box in Teamleader Focus showing payment details and a QR code.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/39164370636305)
 

Fill in a **payment date**. This can also be a date in the future.

- Choose a **payment method **or add a new one. New payment methods will be added to the list of available payment methods for outgoing invoices too. Find more information about payment methods [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693982414097-How-To-Payment-methods-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- 
**Full payment:** by default, the slider next ‘Full payment’ is enabled and this is also the only option when adding a payment to a receipt or an incoming credit note. For incoming invoices, you can also add **partial payments:**

Disable the slider next to ‘Full payment’ and enter the ‘Paid amount’.
![A form section for recording a partial payment on an invoice.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/39164370637841)

- If the amount of payments exceeds or equals the total monetary amount of the expense then it’s not possible to add an additional payment anymore.

- Expenses will be fully paid if the sum of all added payments equals the full amount including VAT of the expense. Note that you can’t edit the total incl. VAT of an expense anymore after it has been fully paid.
 

- For internal purposes you can fill out a **remark **about this payment.

- 
**Pay via QR code **[ONLY FOR INCOMING INVOICES]: for quick and secure payments of your incoming invoices you can always pay by scanning the QR code displayed here. (Note that for Belgium, Payconiq by Bancontact is not supported). After scanning the code, always check if the payment details are correct in your bank app before paying.

A QR code will only be generated if required fields such as the IBAN number of the supplier and the amount are filled out. If not, a broken QR code will be shown.

- When you change the ‘Paid amount’ of the payment then a new QR code will be generated instantly.
 

- Click on **Add payment**.

- On your expense detail page a new status label such as ‘Paid’ or ‘Partially paid’ will be added next to the title of the expense.

- In the tab ‘Payments’, your payment(s) will be linked.

- 
**Activity log**: in the detail tab of your expense > ‘Activities’, you can find when payments were added, edited or removed for an expense and by whom.

# Edit a payment

It’s always possible to edit or remove a payment from an expense.

- To **edit **a payment, click on the **pencil **next to the payment.

- Click on the **link icon **to **unlink **a payment. Note that this won’t undo the payment itself.
 

# Expenses overview

In the expenses overview, you can add columns that provide more insights into the payment status of your expenses. Add these columns to your expenses overview by clicking on the **cogwheel **in the top right-hand corner.

- 
**Payment status**

Paid: an expense is fully paid if the sum of all added payments (= the ‘paid amount’) equals the total incl. VAT of the expense.

- Partially paid (only for incoming invoices): the payment is linked, but there’s still an outstanding part to be paid.

- Not paid: no payments linked.

- Unknown: the payment status is shown as ‘Unknown’ if the total including VAT is missing (even if the total excluding VAT is filled out).

- 
**Paid amount: **total amount of payments linked

- 
**Date paid: **date when the expense was fully paid
 

Easily **filter **on payment status or date paid by clicking on **Filters **in your expenses overview:

![Filtering invoices by payment status 'Paid' and a specific 'Date paid' after 01-09-2025.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/39164417099537)

You can also mark expenses as paid in bulk by clicking on the check boxes next to them > **Mark as paid.** Note that these expenses will then be fully paid as it's not possible to add partial payments in bulk.
