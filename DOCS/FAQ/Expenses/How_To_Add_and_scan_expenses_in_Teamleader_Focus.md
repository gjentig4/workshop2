# How

There are three ways to add expenses to your Teamleader Focus account:

- [Upload & scan your expenses automatically](#h_01JRSN28K09QBCW7934NWRQRMP)

## Upload & scan your expenses automatically

! Important to know is that in all Teamleader Focus accounts, expenses will be scanned* *automatically *by default, that’s why we start explaining this option first. 
**Scanning of your expenses will happen via OCR. OCR is short for ‘Optical character recognition’, which essentially means that all information will be fetched from your file and filled out automatically in Teamleader Focus.*

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34357001616401)

You can turn off this setting via **Settings > Expenses > Preferences > Disable the slider** next to ‘Automatically scan all expenses’ .
 

Follow these steps to start adding expenses:

- Navigate to **Expenses **via the navigation menu **> Upload,** or click on the **plus icon **in the top right-hand corner > **Expense**.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34357001619089)

- Upload your files or drag and drop your file(s) here.

Notes:

You can only upload 10 files in 1 go

- The maximum size of a file is 20 MB

- The format needs to be PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG, HEIC, or GIF.

- If you upload an expense with the same document type, supplier, document number and invoice date, we will show you a warning that you're adding a potential duplicate. Be sure to review all the details.
 

- There’s a maximum of 100 free scans every month. At the start of every month, the counter in the top right-hand corner of your expense overview resets to 100. Scans you haven’t used will be lost. 

Once the free scan limit is reached, an admin can **enable the Teamleader Focus wallet** to continue scanning documents. Navigate to [**Settings > Expenses**](https://focus.teamleader.eu/settings/expenses) > Preferences > ‘Use Teamleader Wallet when free scans are used up’. 
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34356986522513)

Every scan will cost €0.10 and will be deducted from your wallet. [Top up your wallet here](https://focus.teamleader.eu/web/settings/wallet) or read all about it [in this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691506715921-FAQ-What-can-I-do-with-the-credits-in-my-Teamleader-Focus-wallet) 
 

- After selecting your file(s), scanning of the document will start:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34356986525713)
 

- The file is now scanned and ready for you to **review**. Click on **Review:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34356986529169)**
** **

- In the next screen you’ll find a visual representation of your file on the left, with the **document details** on the right of the screen. 

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34357001633297)

Thanks to OCR, all fields will be filled out automatically (like amount, due date, payment reference or the document type - invoice, credit note or receipt), but you can of course always change the data manually here. 

*Note: *The field **‘supplier’ **will also be auto-selected if a supplier is already a known customer in your account. Know that we don’t distinguish between regular contacts/companies or suppliers in your account, but if you want to search on expenses per supplier you can always do that via your expenses overview. Find more information on search and filtering in expenses [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357245712657-How-To-Filter-search-overview-in-expenses).
 

- When you’ve reviewed everything, click on **Save **in the top right-hand corner. You’ll be redirected to the **detail page of the expense** where you’ll find:

A **header **with all the information related to the expense. Here, you can still edit the expense via the pencil, download the PDF of your expense, customise the header or delete the expense.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34357001636625)
 

- 
**Mark the expense as approved, pending or refused**: via this button you can keep track of which expenses are ready to be paid, which expenses you still need to check or which expenses aren’t correct. [Read all about it in this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357191325201-How-To-Approve-or-refuse-expenses-in-Teamleader-Focus)
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34357001646097)
 

- 
**Configure bookkeeping email/Send to bookkeeper:** only approved documents can be sent to your bookkeeper. Read all about setting a bookkeeping email address and sending your expenses to your bookkeeper [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357221963409-How-To-Send-expenses-to-your-bookkeeping-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- In the **Details **tab you find an activity feed of your expense, making it possible to track every action related to your expense (e.g. changing the review status, sending it to your bookkeeper etc.). 
 

**What if my scan failed?**

If there’s a technical error during scanning then you won’t lose a free scan, or - if you’ve already used up your free scans - we won’t charge you for the scan.

There are two exceptions when a free scan will be subtracted anyway, so be cautious of the following things before uploading a file:

- When the file is password protected

- When the file is a blank page
 

## Upload your expenses and fill out the information manually

If you disable the automatic scanning of your expenses in your **Settings **> **Expenses**, then you can of course still upload your expenses and click on Scan manually (or when your free scans are used up, just fill out all the information manually).

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34356986543889)
 

- Navigate to **Expenses **and click on **Upload **to upload one or several files.

- The file will be added to the ‘In review’ section with the label ‘New’ attached to it:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34356986546193)
 

- Click on **Review **to review the document and fill out the remaining fields.

You can still choose to scan this file by checking the box next to the expense in the expenses overview and choose ‘Scan’, or by clicking on Scan in the document details.

*![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34356986548625)*
* *

- When all the fields are filled out, **save **the file to add the expense to your overview.
 

## Peppol integration (e-invoices only)

*! This section is only relevant if you have a Belgian or Luxembourg company entity.*
 

A third way to add expenses, and more specifically incoming invoices, to your Teamleader Focus account is to let them be added automatically via Peppol.
 

[Click here](https://focus.teamleader.eu/settings.php#company_information) to set up Peppol [or follow the steps in this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/28079545197713-How-To-Receiving-e-invoices-via-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus) to enable Peppol in your account. Not only will you be able to send your outgoing invoices via Peppol, your incoming invoices will end up in your **Expenses **overview too.

If the supplier of the invoice is not known yet, then a new company will be created in your CRM automatically.
