![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

When navigating to **Settings **> **Teams**, you'll have the possibility to create teams and you'll also be able to select a leader for every team. In this article we will give you more info about the rights of the leader. 

 

If you want to know more about how to create a team in Teamleader Focus, [please read this article. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690706850321-How-To-Creating-a-team-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

## Calendar

A leader will be able to hide their agenda from the team members. A user with [admin rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) can deactivate the option 'Team members can see my agenda' via **Settings **> **Users** > click on the **name **of the leader > 'Permissions' > 'Calendar'. A leader will also have the possibility to have access to the calendar of the entire team.

## Timesheets

- A leader will have access to the timesheets of all the members of the team.

- A leader will be able to hide his or her timesheets from the team members by deactivating the above mentioned toggle 'Team members can see my agenda'.

- A leader can track time (both single and [multiple time trackings](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)) for another user.

## User management

- A team leader with access to 'User management' will be able to access **Settings > Users **and *view all the users that are in their team.*

- A team leader will therefore be able to e.g. set [the external price](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691956252177-How-To-Setting-different-types-of-hourly-rates) of users in their team and, if applicable, set up [vacation types](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691956252177-How-To-Setting-different-types-of-hourly-rates) for them.

 

## Leave requests

When adding a team, you'll also have the possibility to decide who will be in charge of[ approving leave requests](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691095003153-How-To-Approving-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus). This can be the responsibility of the leader or another user:
