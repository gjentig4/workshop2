You just received an invitation for an own personal Teamleader Focus account? Great, then the next step should be setting up your personal account and setting a new password.

 

## Setting a new password

- Accept the invitation

- Check whether your name and the email address are correct. You might get the message that your email address is already in use for another Teamleader Focus account, which means you can only use the email address in one of the two accounts and should change one.

- Fill in a password. This password needs to be at least 6 characters. In case you'd like to add an additional layer of security to your account, we advise you to set up the MFA security mentioned below.

 

## Account security

- If you want to change the above mentioned password, you can do so here by clicking on **Change ****password**. More information on resetting or changing your password can be found in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691103419281-FAQ-How-do-I-reset-my-password).

- You can also see which social/work accounts are connected to your Teamleader Focus account via SSO. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693981217041-How-To-Log-in-to-Teamleader-Focus-via-Single-sign-on).

 

## Adding/changing personal details

- Click on **your user icon **in the top right-hand corner > Click on **My ****profile**.

- Click on the **pencil** next to 'Details'

- Fill in your details:

You can change your name here.

- Also your phone or mobile phone number and your function can be filled out here.

 

## Language

- Click on **your user icon** in the top right-hand corner > Click on **My ****profile**.

- You can choose a language from the 'Language' list. This won't change the language of the account but only applies to your personal account.

 

## Date format

If you have multiple entities or colleagues in your account that are located in countries using different date formats, chances are that users could easily get confused by the account date format as it might differ from what they are used to.
