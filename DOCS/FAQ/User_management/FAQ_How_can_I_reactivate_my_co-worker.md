![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691458624273)

 

If you need to reactivate a user for whatever reason after you had previously deactivated his or her account, simply follow the steps below.

- Navigate to **Settings **> **Users**, where you'll find a list of active, invited and deactivated users. For more information on how to deactivate a co-worker, [click here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690718823953-How-To-Deactivating-a-user-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- Click on ‘Deactivated’.

- Click on the **name of the user**

- On the next page, you'll be able to reactivate this user by clicking on **Activate user **in the top right-hand corner.

- 
**Confirm **the action. Now you can (re)define the user permissions of this user. 

*Notes: *

- You can only reactivate a user when it has been deactivated, but it’s not possible to reactivate permanently deleted users.

- It's only possible to reactivate a user with a [unique email address](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693476202001-FAQ-What-s-the-value-of-a-unique-and-verified-email-address-per-user-account). [Please reach out to us](mailto:username@teamleader.eu) if the deactivated user doesn't have a unique email address and mention the new unique email address that he/she would like to use.
