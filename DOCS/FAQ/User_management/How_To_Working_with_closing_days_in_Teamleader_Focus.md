# How To: Working with closing days in Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691743828369)

 

Is your company closed on specific days of the week? Or will your company be closed during the holidays, and would you like to add these days to your colleagues' agendas? Then follow the steps below.

 

# Setting a closing day

- Go to **Settings** > **Holiday management** > Scroll down to "Closing days". By default, all weekends and the official banking holidays of your country are set as closing days. These are displayed in grey.

- In order to mark a day as closing day, you just need to click on the day.

The day is marked grey under **Settings > Holiday management** > 'Closing days' and in the agendas of all colleagues. 

- If you try to schedule tasks or meetings with colleagues on those days, a message will appear stating that the entire company will be on leave this day.

- The closing day(s) will be greyed out in your or your colleagues' timesheets overview (this however doesn't keep you from adding time to these days). 

- When [adding multiple time trackings](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus), the closing day(s) will be greyed out in the overview (but it'll still be possible to add time for these days).

 

# Removing a closing day

- Go to **Settings** > **Holiday management **> Scroll down to "Closing days".

- In order to remove a day as closing day, you just need to click on the day.

- The day is neither marked grey under **Settings** > **Holiday management **nor in the agendas of all colleagues, anymore.

- Meetings and tasks can be booked again without an error message.

 

# Obtaining reports on closing days

- Go to **Settings** > **Holiday management** > Scroll down to "Closing days".

- Click on the **three dots **next to "Closing days".

- Click on **Export.**

- This provides you with an overview of when different Teamleader Focus users will be out of office.

 

# External holiday management

If you use an external tool for holiday management, this might interfere with your closing days in Teamleader Focus. This is why we've made it possible to turn off holiday management and manage closing days externally. The external information can then be synced to Teamleader Focus.
