# FAQ: How can I grant or remove administrator rights?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

Every Teamleader Focus account has at least one administrator, who has [more rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) than other users. As an admin, you can grant administrator rights to other users and remove them from other users.

 

To grant or remove admin rights, follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings > Users**

- Click on **the name of a user **

- On the next page, click on **Make admin** or **Remove admin **in the top right-hand corner

- 
**Confirm **the action.

 

Remarks

- To be able to grant or remove admin rights, you need access to 'Users'.

- There is no limit to the number of admin users per Teamleader Focus account.

However, there always needs to remain one admin in the account

- Only the first admin automatically has access to all modules. If you are granted admin rights at a later stage, some modules still need to be activated for you.
