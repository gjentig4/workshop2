## Insights

## Users

- Admin users can see and edit all users. (*! But the admin needs to have access to 'User management')*

[Admin users can grant admin rights to other users](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690956768913-FAQ-How-can-I-grant-or-remove-administrator-rights)

- 
[Admin users can remove admin rights from other users](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690956768913-FAQ-How-can-I-grant-or-remove-administrator-rights), including themselves
Note that there always needs to remain one admin in the account

- Admin users can grant or refuse users access to certain modules within Teamleader Focus via **Settings **> **Users **> **name of the user > **'Permissions'.

- They do not need holiday approval *(f**eature available in our '*[*Boost*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697618837009-Features-per-package-GO-MOVE-BOOST)*' and *[*FLOW *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)*packages)*. So even when an admin is in a team and you choose a responsible for holiday approval different from the admin, the holiday will be approved right away without an approval of the person assigned responsible.
*! Important to note is that the admin needs to have access to Users, otherwise they'll still need approval by the leader of their team for their leave requests.*
