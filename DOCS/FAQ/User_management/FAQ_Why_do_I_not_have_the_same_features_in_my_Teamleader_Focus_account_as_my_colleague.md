# FAQ: Why do I not have the same features in my Teamleader Focus account as my colleague?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691605178385)

 

The Teamleader Focus tool consists of multiple functionalities: CRM, Quotations, Deals, Timesheets, Invoices, Projects, Shared inbox, ... In case those features [are included in your package or you've bought additional Boosters ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)they will appear in the menu on your left-hand side.

 

Other features could be export, order confirmations, delivery notes, orders, settings, users. A colleague of yours working in the same Teamleader Focus account has access to more features? The underlying reason here could be that a certain feature has been activated for your Teamleader Focus account, but not for your user profile.

 

To see an overview of the active features per user, an admin user can simply navigate to **Settings** > **Users **and click on the name of a user. On the following page in 'Permissions', you'll see all active features for the general Teamleader Focus account. If the slider is enabled for a certain feature, this feature will also be available for that specific user.

In the example above, the feature "Settings" is not active for this specific user.
