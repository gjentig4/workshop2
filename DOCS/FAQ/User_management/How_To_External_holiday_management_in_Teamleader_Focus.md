# How To: External holiday management in Teamleader Focus

![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28017249806865)

If you use an external tool for holiday management, this might interfere with your leave and vacation types in Teamleader Focus. This is why we've made it possible to turn off holiday management and manage it externally. The external information can then be synced to Teamleader Focus. Read more about it here.

 

As a user with access to the settings, follow these steps to manage holidays externally:

- Go to **Settings** > **Holiday** **management**

- In ‘Preferences’, **enable** the toggle next to ‘Manage holidays externally’. 
Note that this is an *account-wide setting,* meaning this setting will be applied for all the users in the whole account.

! When enabled, your current holiday set-up in Teamleader Focus will be irretrievably lost. This also means that when you would later disable this toggle again, old holiday information won’t be restored. The following information from Teamleader Focus will be deleted for every user:

Days off

- Closing days

- Vacation types

- 
[Via API](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692808751761-Getting-started-What-is-API-in-Teamleader-Focus), set up an integration with an external holiday management tool.

- Manage, request and approve all holidays, vacation types and closing days in your external tool, and all this holiday information will then be synced to your account in *read-only mode.* The frequency of this sync will be completely dependent on the integration itself.

*Good to know:* if the toggle is turned off in the settings at a later stage but the integration with the external tool still exists, then old days off, vacation types and closing days won’t disappear from the account.
