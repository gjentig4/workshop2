![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697824290833)

What if you’ve invited users to your Teamleader Focus account but they did not accept the invitation in time and the link expired? Or what if your employee did not receive his or her invite? Follow the steps below to discover how to send your user invite again.

 

After you’ve [added user licenses to your account](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692210395793-How-To-How-do-I-buy-a-new-user-licence-for-my-Teamleader-Focus-account) and after actually [inviting your employees to Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690695274513-How-To-Adding-new-users-to-your-Teamleader-Focus-account), your employee will have received an email with the request to accept the invitation.

The invite link will be **valid for seven days**. If the link expires, an admin can resend the invitation to the invitee by following these steps:

- Go to **Settings **> **Users**

- Change the view to ‘Invited’ users.

- Click on the envelope next to the trash bin to resend the invitation to your employee. This invite link will remain valid for seven days as well.
