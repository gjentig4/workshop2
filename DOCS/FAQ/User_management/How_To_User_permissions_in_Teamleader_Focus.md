![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

 

Not every user in Teamleader Focus needs access to the same modules as other users. Read this article to learn everything about user permissions and how you (as an admin) can enable/disable access.

Important remark: When you invite **new** **users **to your Teamleader account, by **default** immediately after accepting the invite the new employee will only be able to see **certain ****modules **like contacts and companies or the calendar and dashboard (depending on your Teamleader Focus package and additional Boosters). That’s why it’s important to know how to change this access.

First of all: only [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)can edit user permissions and enable/disable access to certain modules or features. You can find the user permission overview by following these steps:

- Navigate to **Settings **> **Users**

- Click on the **name **of the user you want to change permissions for

- On the next page, you can find general information about the user at the top of the page, with the tabs 'Permissions' and 'Work info' below.
