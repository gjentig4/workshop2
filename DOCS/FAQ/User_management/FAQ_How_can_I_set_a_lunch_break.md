# FAQ: How can I set a lunch break?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691648934417)

*! If the Planning Booster is part of your package you'll automatically have access to the lunch break functionality too.*
 

To set a lunch break, you can follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings** > **Users **and click on the name of the co-worker you would like to set a lunch break for.

- Go to the tab **Work info **on the next page.

- Click on "**Edit schedule**" next to the current week schedule of the colleague.

- Enable the lunch break slider and set the time frame of the lunch break.

- Click **save.**

 

Example: This co-worker has been working on a task from 11 am to 3 pm and also took their lunch break of an hour. Whenever the co-worker tracks time on the task, they will have the option to take the latter into account when tracking the time. As a result, an hour less will be tracked.

## Note on the time tracker

If the lunch break is enabled, this impacts time tracking [via our time tracker.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693342367249-How-To-Track-time-with-Teamleader-Focus-Time-Tracker-functionality) The lunch break will be deducted from your recorded time automatically (also if the time trackings are billable). If you work during your lunch break and want to bill these hours, we advise against using this functionality.
