# FAQ: Can I combine limited CRM access with limited deal access?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

No, you cannot combine limited CRM access with limited deal access. If you set [limited CRM access](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692271859857-FAQ-What-does-limited-CRM-access-stand-for) for a co-worker, the [limited deal access](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691455806993-FAQ-What-does-limited-deal-access-mean) does not apply anymore. Limited CRM access means your co-worker can only see the customers for which they are account manager, which means they can no longer see any deals of customers who are not assigned to them. 

 

## What is the difference?

Strictly speaking, the greatest difference between both types of limited access is that **limited CRM acce****ss** is more restricting than limited deal access: limited CRM access **applies to more module****s. **A user with limited CRM access will only be able to see the deals, quotations and invoices of companies he or she is responsible for. All other information will be hidden. As for **limited deal access**, **only t****he deals** (and their linked quotations) for which the user is not responsible will be hidden. 

 

If you want to change these settings, navigate to **Settings** > **Users **> the **name of the user** which you want to edit > 'Permissions'. Adapt the toggles as you see fit.
