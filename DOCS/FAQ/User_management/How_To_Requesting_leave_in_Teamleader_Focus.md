![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690715480209)

- Navigate to the user icon in the top right hand corner and click on **My profile**.

- Go to your calendar. Click on a single day or click and drag to select multiple days on which you wish to take leave

- Select the kind of leave you prefer from the dropdown menu

- You then have two options:

- Select “**Yes**” next to “All day” to take the entire day off.

- Deselect “**Yes**” next to “All day” in order to specify the hours. That way you can also take half a day off

Note: It is possible that you do not have the option to select specific hours. Then the administrator of your account specified under **Settings **> Holiday management > Vacation types that this leave type can only be taken in full days.
