![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691910335761)

 

The best way to keep track of your sales opportunities in Teamleader Focus, is to add deals. In this article, you will learn about the different ways to add them. 

- Via Deals

- Via the plus sign

- Via the plus button on the customer's page

- Web2Leads

## 1. Via Deals

- The first possibility is to simply click on **Add deal** in the top right-hand corner in the Deals module.

- A screen will open in which you can complete the details:

- Give your deal a title and select a customer from your Contacts/Companies. It can prove very useful for your statistics afterwards if you also select a source for your deal. This list can be managed under **Settings** > **Deals and Quotations **>** Preferences**. 

- Next, you can add the amount the deal is worth. Don’t worry if you don’t know yet at this stage, you can easily add this information later. 

- Select a [pipeline ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus)for your deal. The pipeline that's auto-suggested will be based on what a user selected in their Kanban board on the deal overview page.

- Lastly, you’ll see that you can select 'Assigned to'. By default, Teamleader Focus will fill in the user that has added the deal. You also have the option to add a second assignee to a deal. To do so, simply [send an email to our support team, so they can activate this feature for you](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065). This way not only one but two colleagues receive notifications whenever the deal is updated.

 

## 2. Via the plus sign

Another possibility to add a deal is to use the plus sign on top of your screen. 

1. Go to Contacts/Companies and open the contact or company you want to add a deal for. Next click on the grey plus sign in right upper corner and select **deal**: ![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691910408337)

 

2. In the next screen you’ll see the customer has already been completed.

3. You can now add the rest of the information as explained above.

 

## 3. [Via the plus button on the customer's page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page)

When you’re looking for an overview of your deals per customer we suggest you navigate to your contact/company page. There you’ll find the following overview:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691901514897)
