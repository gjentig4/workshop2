Read on to find out how you can do this.

 

## Making a quotation available on CloudSign

- 
Making a quotation available via the quotation actions

- 
Making a quotation available via the linked deal

- 
Sending your quotation to the customer

### Making a quotation available via the quotation actions

- In the overview of your quotations, you'll find a column 'CloudSign activity', so you can see which of your quotations are available for your leads or customers. ‘Online’ quotations are available, ‘Offline’ ones are not:

### Making a quotation available via the linked deal

- 
Navigate to your deal overview and select the deal for which you want to change the CloudSign availability settings.

- 
Scroll down to the follow-up section, click on the **three ****dots **next to your quotation and select **Make ****available ****on ****CloudSign**: 
![Dropdown menu for quotation actions with 'Make available on CloudSign' highlighted](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693746966289)

- 
You will get a notification saying the quotation is now available with the option to copy the link to the quotation on CloudSign, making it easier to share it immediately.

- 
In the quotation overview of the deal, you will see below ‘CloudSign activity’ which of your quotations are available for your leads or customers. ‘Online’ quotations are available, ‘Offline’ ones are not:![CloudSign activity widget showing online and offline status links](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693717544209)

- 
You can repeat these steps for every quotation in your deal. 

 

### Sending your quotation to the customer

Sending an offline quotation via CloudSign will also automatically change its availability to ‘online’. Make sure the variable #LINK is included when sending your quotation though.

 

## Previewing your quotation on CloudSign

Before sending your quotation to your customer, you might want to preview the quotation first to see what it looks like on CloudSign. Read everything about that [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693807353233-FAQ-Can-I-see-a-preview-of-my-quotation-in-CloudSign). Bear in mind you can **only preview your quotation after you've made it available on CloudSign.**

**![The 'Send quotation' dropdown menu in Teamleader Focus with 'Remove from CloudSign' highlighted.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693738257681)**

### Notes

- Making a quotation available on CloudSign does not mean the quotation will be sent automatically to your customer, it only means that the quotation will show up when the customer or lead clicks the Cloudsign link. To find out how you can easily share online quotations with your leads and customers, check [this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign)

- When you send one quotation of a specific deal using CloudSign, all online quotations from this deal will automatically be available for your lead or customer to consult, i.e. there is no separate link for every quotation. If you only want to show one quotation, make sure to remove the others from CloudSign using the instructions above.

- Removing a quotation from CloudSign does not mean you remove it from your account. The instructions for deleting a quotation can be found [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693746481937-FAQ-Can-I-delete-a-quotation).
