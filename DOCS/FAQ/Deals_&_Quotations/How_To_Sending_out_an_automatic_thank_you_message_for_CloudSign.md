Whenever a potential customer converts into a paying customer by accepting your quotation through CloudSign, you can choose to send an automatic thank you message via Teamleader Focus.

- Go to **Settings **> **Cloud ****platforms** > **Email after approval of a quote via CloudSign**

- Click on the plus sign.

- Specify the language. Note that you can only set one template per language.

- Specify the name and the subject

- Insert the email content using the available variables.

- Click **Save**.

- As soon as a customer signs a quotation, he/she will receive an email containing the body you set earlier, together with a pdf of the signed quotation.

## Notes

- Teamleader Focus sends the thank you message in the same language as the quotation. In case there is no template set for one language, then there will also be no thank you note sent out.

- Enabling this thank you message deactivates the standard 'Quotation sign confirmation' email customers receive after signing. We advise you to use this customisable thank you message if you want to personalise the standard sign confirmation.
