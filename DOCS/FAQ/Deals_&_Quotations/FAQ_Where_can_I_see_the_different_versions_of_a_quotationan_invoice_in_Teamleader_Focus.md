# FAQ: Where can I see the different versions of a quotation/an invoice in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691258267793)

Whenever you edit a quotation/an invoice, you can still access its previous versions. In this article we'll give you an overview on where you can find this version history.

## Contacts/companies

You find the version history by navigating to the page of the contact/company your quotation/invoice is linked to. There, click on the **Files **button and in this overview you'll find your quotations/invoices as well. Right clicking on a file gives you the option to 'Show history'.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691244448145)
