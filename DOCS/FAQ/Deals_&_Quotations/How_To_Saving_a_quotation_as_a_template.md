# How To: Saving a quotation as a template

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691263477009)

 

If you frequently use the same quotation over and over again then you can create a model for it and save the quotation as a template:

- Go to [your deal page.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page)

- Go to the section 'Follow up on your deal'.

- Click on the 3 dots next to your quotation.

- Select the option **Save quotation as template**.

This way, the content of the quotation is saved and can be reused when creating a new deal.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691256517521)

 

*Note: *Attachments in quotations won't be saved to the quotation template.

 

### Advanced options

You can find your quotation templates in **Settings > Deals > Templates for quotation content**.

You can edit a template by clicking on the pencil next to it. Here you can change your product descriptions, prices, quantities, VAT rates etc. 

 

Important are the advanced options here, which you can find by clicking on **Show ****advanced** **options **below your template content.

When enabling this slider, the most recent product prices will be used in your quotation. This means that if you were to go to your product list and change the price of a product that is used in this template, that this adapted price will be used whenever you use this quotation template - no matter what prices the template was saved with.

 

When the slider is disabled the product prices of the quotation template itself will be used, even if you've changed the product prices in your product list later.

### Copying a quotation

Next to being able to save a quotation as a template you can also **copy **a quotation.
