# FAQ: How can I send my quotation via email attached as PDF?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690961934865)

 

In our never ending quest for ways to work smarter, we developed [Cloudsign](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign), a platform to send online quotations and get your customer to accept them. However, it is also perfectly possible to send your quotation as a PDF file attached to your mail, instead of only providing the link to Cloudsign. This means you have two options:

 

## Send PDF plus Cloudsign

1. Set up Cloudsign using [these instructions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign).

2. Navigate to **Settings **> **Deals and Quotations** and enable the toggle ‘Send quotations in attachment when sending to customers’*. *

 

Now your customer will receive both a link to Cloudsign and the quotation as a PDF file.

 

## Send PDF instead of Cloudsign

1. Navigate to **Settings **> **Deals and Quotations **and scroll down to ‘Email templates for quotation layout’.

2. Click on the **pencil **next to your templates and delete the #LINK variable from your email body.

3. Scroll back up and enable the toggle ‘Send quotations in attachment when sending to customers’*. *

 

Your customer will now only receive an email with the quotation attached as a PDF file.

 

That is all, now there is nothing holding you back to start closing those deals!
