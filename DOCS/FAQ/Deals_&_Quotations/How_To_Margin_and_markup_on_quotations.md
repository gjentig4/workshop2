# How To: Margin and markup on quotations

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693005417489)

 

The margin on quotations feature allows you to calculate margin and markup per quotation in Teamleader Focus. Read everything about this feature here!

 

## Margin vs Markup

First it's important to explain the difference between margin and markup. To put it simply:**Margin is a subtraction (unit price minus the unit cost), while markup is an addition (unit cost+ percentage).**

### Margin

With margin on quotations, you will be able to add and view the unit costs of quotation lines and gain insight into the margin of a quotation as the margin will be automatically calculated.

 

**Margin **is the unit price minus the unit cost.  

For example, if a product sells for €100 and costs €70 to manufacture (= unit cost), its margin is €30. Or, stated as a percentage, the margin percentage is 30%.

 

### Markup

**Markup **is the amount by which the cost (= unit cost) of a product is increased in order to derive the unit price. To use the preceding example, a markup of €30 from the €70 cost yields the €100 price. Or, stated as a percentage, the markup percentage is 42.9% (calculated as the markup amount divided by the product cost).

## Users with no access to unit cost/margin on quotations

When the unit cost and margin are enabled for your user, you can access this information when adding, editing and copying quotations.

 

When you don't have access however you'll see the following warning when editing a quotation:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693065806993)

- This essentially means that if unit costs have been added (by another user that edited the quotation or by adding a product that has a registered unit cost) then these unit costs are added in the background.

- This also means that when a user - without access to unit cost/margin - copies a quotation with unit costs, these unit costs will also be copied over in the background.

- Users without access to the unit cost/margin won't be able to view the Margin field on deal level either.

 

## Notes

- When you have [multiple quotations per deal:](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus) When displaying the deal margin, the average of the margins in the open quotations will be taken into account.  

- Nor the margin nor the unit costs will be visible for your customer.

- The type (recurrency) of the product(s) on your quotation won't be taken into account when calculating the margin. The margin will be based on the one-time cost of the product.
