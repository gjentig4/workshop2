If you often create similar quotations, then you can copy these in Teamleader Focus starting from an existing quotation or you can choose an existing quotation when creating a new quotation. Read all about it here! 

## Copy a quotation starting from an existing quotation

You can copy a quotation from an existing quotation, either from the quotation page directly, or from the deal page.

From the quotation page

- Click the **3 dots **in the header of the quotation

- Choose **Copy quotation****![The quotation actions menu in Teamleader Focus, highlighting the 'Copy quotation' option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693555824657)**

- Concerning the field 'Deal', you have three options:

Copy the quotation to the same deal. Then you'll have [multiple quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus) in your deal. This comes in handy when you want to offer your customer different options of the same opportunity. 

- Copy the quotation to another, already existing deal 

- Copy the quotation to a new deal by clicking **+New deal**

From the [deal page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page)

- 
Next to ‘Follow up on your open deal’, click on the **three ****dots **next to your quotation

- 
Choose **Copy**![The quotation actions menu in a deal overview, highlighting the 'Rename' option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693475600913)

- 
Concerning the field 'Deal', you have three options (mentioned above).

## Copy a quotation when creating a new quotation

When you create a quotation, we will ask you a question first:

*“Would you rather base your quotation on an existing one?” *

- 
When you regularly create the same quotations this means you don’t have to start writing your quotation from scratch all over again. 

- 
Click on **Use existing quotation** and in the next screen you'll be able to select the existing quotation that needs to be used as the basis for your new quotation.![The 'Create quotation' dialog box in Teamleader Focus with fields for name, customer, and currency.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693573802769)

### Note

Updating any information while copying (e.g. bulk update product prices, VAT rates,..) is not possible. Everything exactly as on the original quotation will be copied.

## Copying a quotation versus saving a quotation as a template

It still remains possible [to save a quotation as a template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691231613713-How-To-Saving-a-quotation-as-a-template) as well. Functionally, there isn’t that much of a difference between copying a quotation or saving a quotation as a template.However;

- 
Even after the creation of your deal, you can still choose to copy from an existing quotation when creating a new quotation in the deal. When creating a quotation out of a template you have to make this decision before creating the deal.

- 
A big plus of being able to copy quotations is that you don’t need to create a new template for every small variation of your quotation. These variations won’t get saved in your settings and won’t clutter your Teamleader Focus account.
