![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693594115345)

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693591433745)

 

There are two ways to create a quotation in Teamleader Focus. Either from scratch, or via your deal.

 

## Creating a quotation from scratch

To create a quotation from scratch, you just go to your **Quotations **module, and click on **Add quotation **in the top right-hand corner. Or you click on the **+ **at the top of your Teamleader Focus account and choose **Quotation**.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693608979601)

 

- Fill out the required fields, like the name of your quotation and the customer. The name of your quotation will be prefilled as 'Quotation' already, but you can of course still change the name:

*Note that you can also *[*base your quotation on an existing one by clicking on Use existing quotation*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693606511889-FAQ-Can-I-copy-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus)*** **in the top right-hand corner.*

- In the field '**Valid until**', you can set an expiry date for your quotation so you don't lose track of quotations that still need to be signed. [Read everything about this functionality here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695533505553-How-To-Expiry-dates-on-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- As for the field '**Deal**', keep in mind that a linked deal will always be created in the background:

If you leave the field empty, we'll automatically create a new deal for you

- You can also select an already existing deal

- It's also possible to click on **+New deal**, which gives you the opportunity to immediately fill out the name of your deal
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693618789777)
 

- 
Fill out an introduction text for your quotation. You can either leave this field blank, type a text manually or [use one of your predefined templates.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/articles/31592163024913)
 

- Fill out the items on your quotation, either by selecting products from your product database or by typing them manually.

- Click on **Save and preview **and you'll immediately see what your quotation looks like. In 'Display customisation' you can choose to hide certain items on your quotation like unit prices, subtotals or VAT:

You could also just Save the quotation without previewing it, by clicking on the arrow next to 'Save and preview' > **Save.
**

- If you don't like the layout of your quotation or want to hide or display certain items (like the price) then you can adapt the template of your quotation.
