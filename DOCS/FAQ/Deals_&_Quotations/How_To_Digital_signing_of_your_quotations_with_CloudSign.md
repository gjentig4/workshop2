One of those platforms is CloudSign - the perfect way to send online quotations and get your customer to accept them on the spot!

## CloudSign setup

Instead of sending the quotation to your lead via post, you can include a link in the accompanying email that leads to the CloudSign platform. This is how:

- Navigate to “**Settings**” and click “**Deals and Quotations**”

- Click on the “**+**” symbol next to “Email templates for quotations” to create a new one or click on a template from the list to edit

- Add the parameter #LINK somewhere in your email body. The parameter will change automatically to the sentence “view quotation online” once you send the email to your customer
![The configuration form for creating or editing an email template for quotations in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690833115793)

- Click “**Save**”

 

## Sending the quotation(s)

### Via the quotation detail page

- Navigate to your quotation detail page.

- In the top right-hand corner, you'll see the button **Send quotation**
*Note: *Click on the **arrow **next to 'Send quotation'** > Preview on CloudSign** if you want to see a [preview of the quotation](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693807353233-FAQ-Can-I-see-a-preview-of-my-quotation-in-CloudSign) first before sending it your customer.

- After clicking the button, a new pop-up opens. 

- The email address is filled in automatically but can be edited as you see fit. 

- Below “Template”, you choose the template including the link you created earlier.

- Click on **Send**.

 

### Via your deal page

- Navigate to [the deal page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) of the deal in question.

- Go to 'Follow up on your open deal'. Make sure that you created a quotation.
*Note: *Click on the 3 dots > **Preview on CloudSign** next to your quotation if you want to see a [preview of the quotation](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693807353233-FAQ-Can-I-see-a-preview-of-my-quotation-in-CloudSign) first before sending it your customer.

- Click on the 3 dots next to your quotation and choose **Send via email**, or click on the button in the bottom-right hand corner and choose **Send quotations **if you want to send more than one quotation. Read everything about multiple quotations per deal [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- The email address is filled in automatically but can be edited as you see fit.

- Below “Template”, you choose the template including the link you created earlier.

- Click on “**Send quotation(s)**”.

 

**Note: **You can also manually mark quotations as sent without actually sending them (e.g. if you didn't send them via Teamleader Focus). Click on the quotation and click on the arrow next to 'Send quotation' > **Mark as sent.**
**![The dropdown menu for quotation actions in Teamleader Focus, highlighting 'Mark as sent'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690872593553)**

 

### Layout of the email

The email your customer receives will look like this:

![An email notification containing a link to view a quotation online via Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690860060049)

You can slightly change the above layout of the quotation email by navigating to **Settings **> **Email **> **Preferences**. Disable the toggle ‘Use Teamleader design for outgoing emails’ here if you’d rather use your own layout. Keep in mind that this will cause the above thumbnail and background to disappear and only display ‘plain text’.

 

## View of the customer

When your customer clicks the link 'View quotation online' in the email they received, they will be redirected to CloudSign.

 

*Note: *A quotation on CloudSign can be viewed (and signed) on a desktop computer, tablet or mobile phone.

 

This is what your customer sees: 
![CloudSign interface for signing a quotation in Teamleader Focus with multiple quotation options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690860112273)
Your customer is able to:

## CloudSign availability & activity

With [multiple quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus), you can choose which quotations per deal you make available (online) or unavailable (offline) to your customer on CloudSign. Discover everything about CloudSign availability [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693770369937-FAQ-Can-I-make-a-quotation-un-available-on-CloudSign).

## Accepted quotation 

If your customer chooses to sign (one of) the quotation(s), some actions are taken in Teamleader Focus. Your customer also receives a confirmation email containing the signed quotation.

 

### In Teamleader Focus

- 
The responsible employee for the deal and the account manager of the company will be notified immediately of the accepted quotation by email and in Teamleader Focus.

*Note: *
All account admins will also be informed of every accepted quotation by notification and by email, but only if the slider 'Receive an in-app notification each time a deal is marked as won' is enabled in **Settings **> **Deals and Quotations **> Preferences. Every admin has to enable this individually.

 

- You’ll also see that the status of the deal is changed automatically to “Won”, and the quotation receives the label 'Accepted'. The accepted quotation will be at the top of the list as well on your deal page:
![The quotations overview table in Teamleader Focus showing accepted and open offers.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690833308689)

- This information is updated in the Activities of the deal and the quotation.

- You can find the signed quotation ([and previous versions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691266431633-FAQ-Where-can-I-see-the-different-versions-of-a-quotation-an-invoice-in-Teamleader-Focus) of the quotation) in the 'Files' section on your [deal page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) and on your quotation detail page.

*Note: For the customer's signature to appear on the quotation, you need to add one of the following shortcodes to your quotation template: *

*![Table of document signature shortcodes and their descriptions in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690883767953)*
To make the legal validity of a signed quotation more prominent, we also store both the timestamp of the signature (shown in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)) and the IP address of the signer. Both will be displayed on your quotation if you use one of the three signature shortcodes mentioned above.
![A digital signature on a Teamleader Focus document with a timestamp and IP address.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690872903185)

 

### For your customer

After accepting the quotation, your customer will receive a 'Quotation sign confirmation' in their mailbox. This email includes a copy in pdf of the quotation with your customer's signature, and mentions that in case of any issue your customer can contact you.
*Note: this email isn't customisable and differs from the 'Email after approval of a quote via CloudSign' which you can read about *[*here*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691768097937-How-To-Sending-out-an-automatic-thank-you-message-for-CloudSign)*.*

 

## Customisation options

You can also personalise your CloudSign environment and by extension all cloud platforms in Teamleader Focus. Read everything about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690839495441-How-To-Personalising-Teamleader-Focus-cloud-platforms). 

 

## Note on expiry date

Note that if you've set an expiry date on your quotation and you also locked the quotation on CloudSign, your customer won't be able to sign it. The button to sign will be greyed out. Either change the expiry date or unlock the quotation to let your customer sign.
