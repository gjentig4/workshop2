![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

Thanks to our CloudSign platform, you can easily share one or [multiple quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus) with your lead or customer. But it doesn’t end there! Teamleader Focus will also give you some insights into the activity on the platform on three levels. Read on to find out more.

## CloudSign activity

In the follow-up section of your deal page, you will see an overview of all your quotations under the ‘Quotations’ tab. In the column ‘CloudSign activity’, you will have the option to click **View ****activity **to get an overview of the activity for this quotation in a short timeline:![The follow-up section of a won deal in Teamleader Focus showing quotations and CloudSign activity.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693735270033)

 

You'll find the same overview in your quotations module, if you add the column 'CloudSign activity' to your quotations overview:![The Quotations overview list in Teamleader Focus showing a table of unsent quotes.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693756356497)

The overview will tell you when the quotation was made available online, when and how many times it was viewed, if and when feedback was sent and/or if and when it was signed. 

 

The activity data is of course only available for online quotations. To make an offline quotation available online, you can follow [these instructions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693770369937-FAQ-Can-I-make-a-quotation-un-available-on-CloudSign).

## Notifications

Besides being able to see the activity overview, you will also get notifications:

- Whenever the quotation is viewed, the deal responsible will receive an in-app notification, also mentioning the number of times the quotation was viewed online:

- If the deal responsible has [e-mail notifications enabled](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691648678801-FAQ-Can-I-deactivate-the-email-notifications-in-my-Teamleader-Focus-account), he or she will also get notified via email whenever a quotation is viewed or downloaded:

In addition to the overview and the notifications, you will see a history feed of all actions in the activities overview at the bottom of your deal or quotation page:
