# How To: CloudSign activity

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693727305617)

Thanks to our CloudSign platform, you can easily share one or [multiple quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus) with your lead or customer. But it doesn’t end there! Teamleader Focus will also give you some insights into the activity on the platform on three levels. Read on to find out more.

## CloudSign activity

In the follow-up section of your deal page, you will see an overview of all your quotations under the ‘Quotations’ tab. In the column ‘CloudSign activity’, you will have the option to click **View ****activity **to get an overview of the activity for this quotation in a short timeline:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693735270033)

 

You'll find the same overview in your quotations module, if you add the column 'CloudSign activity' to your quotations overview:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693756356497)

The overview will tell you when the quotation was made available online, when and how many times it was viewed, if and when feedback was sent and/or if and when it was signed. 

 

The activity data is of course only available for online quotations. To make an offline quotation available online, you can follow [these instructions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693770369937-FAQ-Can-I-make-a-quotation-un-available-on-CloudSign).

## Notifications

Besides being able to see the activity overview, you will also get notifications:

- Whenever the quotation is viewed, the deal responsible will receive an in-app notification, also mentioning the number of times the quotation was viewed online:
