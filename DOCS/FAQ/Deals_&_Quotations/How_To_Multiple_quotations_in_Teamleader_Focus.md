Providing different options to your customer is part of the sales process. It’s your customer’s mindset to compare and look for the best deal. This is where the ability to create multiple quotations per deal comes in. In this article you’ll learn more about the feature and what it does.![The 'Follow up on your won deal' section in Teamleader Focus showing a list of open quotations.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693696414993)

## What

The road from lead to cash is fairly simple: convince your customer of your goods or services via a quotation, get this quotation signed and convert the quotation into an invoice. 

 

Selling something to your customer however, often means providing different options for the same opportunity, so your customer can choose the best option. Teamleader Focus lets you create multiple quotations per deal.

 

*Note: multiple quotations focuses on offering **different ****options **of the **same ****opportunity**. If you offer a (completely) different good/service to your customer, then we advise you to create a new deal.*

## How

To create multiple quotations, we’ll first have to start by [creating a new deal.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691911529617-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-deal) After your deal is created, go to the [deal overview page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page), where you’ll find detailed information on the deal. 

 

Secondly, start creating a first quotation for the deal:

- Click on the **plus ****icon **next to ‘Follow up on your open deal’

- Add the items on your quotation and choose a quotation template

- 
Save the quotation

Then, there are different ways to add multiple quotations. We list them here:

 

### From scratch

Use the **plus ****icon **next to ‘Follow up on your open deal’ to start adding **additional ****quotations**. Use this option if the additional quotation you want to create differs (a lot) from your first one; e.g. you need to add lots of different products to the quotation. 

 

### Duplicate a quotation within the same deal

If the second quotation you want to create only differs slightly from your first one (e.g. changes in price), then use this option to duplicate the first quotation you created **within ****the ****same ****deal**:

- Click on the **three ****dots **next to the first quotation of the deal

- Choose **Copy**. Find more information on copying a quotation in [this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693606511889-FAQ-Can-I-copy-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Choose ‘Deal' > Current deal.

- Here you’ll find a copy of your original quotation. Make any adaptations you want to the quotation by editing the articles or the prices.

- Give your additional quotation a **Name**. Call it ‘Quotation X-option 2’ for example so you can identify a variation more easily. Read everything about renaming quotations afterwards [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693511139089-How-To-Renaming-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus). If you want to display the name of your quotation on the pdf of your document as well, don't forget to use the shortcode $QUOTATION_NAME$ on your template.

- Click on **Save and preview.**

 

### [Copy quotation (from another deal)](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693606511889-FAQ-Can-I-copy-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus)

Another option is to create an additional quotation but use the content of an already existing quotation from another deal:

- Click on the **plus ****icon **to add an additional quotation to the deal

- Click on **Use ****existing ****quotation **in the top right-hand corner

![The 'Add product' dialog in Teamleader Focus for creating a new quotation.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693707983249)
 

- Choose customer and a deal + quotation

- Click on **Continue ****to ****quotation** 
 

*Note: there’s also the option to save your quotation as a template, which you can read more about *[*here*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691231613713-How-To-Saving-a-quotation-as-a-template)*.*

## One accepted quotation per deal

You can create multiple quotations per deal, but **only one of those can be accepted.**

We advise you to create a new, different deal and create a quotation for that deal if you want more quotations for the same customer to be accepted.

### Marking a quotation as accepted

When there are multiple quotations per deal, there is no 1 on 1 relationship with the deal, so moving the deal phase to “won” doesn’t suffice to mark a quotation as accepted.

 

*Note**: your customer can also **refuse **a quotation via CloudSign, or you can manually mark quotation(s) as refused to reduce clutter. *[*Read all about it here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696076910737-How-To-Mark-a-quotation-as-refused)

 

A quotation can get accepted in two ways:

- Via [CloudSign](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign); when your customer marks one of the quotations as accepted, it’ll automatically be accepted in Teamleader Focus and your deal will be marked as won

- By manually marking a quotation as accepted:

Via the quotation page:

Click on the **arrow **next to **Send quotation**

- Choose **Mark as accepted**
![The quotation action menu in Teamleader Focus with 'Mark as accepted' highlighted.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693708019217)
 

- Via the deal page:

Click on the **three ****dots **next to the quotation you want to mark as accepted

- Choose **Mark ****as ****accepted**
**![List of open quotations with a dropdown menu highlighting the 'Mark as accepted' option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693682347281)**
 

Use case: “What if the wrong quotation in my deal got accepted and my customer wants to be able to accept another one?”

- Edit the originally accepted quotation by clicking on the **three ****dots **next to it > **Edit**

- You don’t need to change the content of the quotation, just click on **Save**

- The status of the quotation changes from ‘Accepted’ to ‘Unsent’.
Important: editing an already accepted quotation will also remove the signature of your customer!

- Your customer can now accept (one of) the other quotation(s) 
 

### Creating documents from quotations

As stated above, only one quotation can be accepted per deal. An accepted quotation will be leading, but you retain the flexibility to create other documents for the other quotation(s).

 

When creating a document, you get to choose from which quotation you want to continue:

![Dropdown menu to select a quotation when creating an order confirmation in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693711216785)

 

In an open deal, you can create the following documents: 

- Another quotation

- Project

- Order confirmation

 

In a won deal, you can create the following documents:

- Another quotation

- Invoice

- Project

- Order

- Order confirmation

- Delivery note  
 

## Status on quotation level

The **status **of your quotations will always be visible on your deal and quotation overview page, providing a better overview. A quotation can have the following statuses:

- 
Not sent: you didn’t sent this quotation to your customer yet

- 
Sent: you sent this quotation to your customer

- 
Accepted: the customer either signed the quotation via CloudSign or you marked it as accepted manually. An accepted quotation will always be at the top of the list in a separate tab.

- 
[Refused:](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696076910737-How-To-Mark-a-quotation-as-refused) the customer either refused the quotation via CloudSign or you marked it as refused manually.

- 
[Expired](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695533505553-How-To-Expiry-dates-on-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus): the quotation is expired.

 

## Preview your quotation(s) on CloudSign

Before sending your quotation(s) to your customer, you might want to preview the quotation(s) first to see what it looks like on CloudSign. Read everything about that [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693807353233-FAQ-Can-I-see-a-preview-of-my-quotation-in-CloudSign).

 

## Sending multiple quotations

With the multiple quotations feature, it’s possible to send multiple quotations in one go to your customer.

- In the follow-up section, click on the **Send ****quotations **button:
![A list of open quotations in Teamleader Focus with a 'Send quotations' button highlighted.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693711270801)

- Check the boxes next to the quotations you want to send

- Find the send dialog in the next screen, where you’ll find an overview of **how **the quotations will be sent exactly (via CloudSign and/or via attachments)

![The 'Send quotations' dialog showing CloudSign links, PDF attachments, and an add attachment option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693696754705)

*Notes*:

To make sure the quotations are sent **via **CloudSign, add the variable #LINK to your template. When there is no #LINK, quotations won’t be available on CloudSign. 

- The ‘Via Attachments’ links back to a slider in your **Settings **> **Deals and Quotations **> **Send quotations in attachment when sending to customers.**
Make sure it’s enabled when you also want to send your quotations in attachment.
![Preferences setting to send quotations as attachments to customers.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693711379345)

- When you send one quotation of a specific deal using CloudSign, all online quotations from this deal will automatically be available for your customer to consult, i.e. there is no separate link for every quotation. If you only want to show one quotation, make sure to remove the others from CloudSign. Read more about CloudSign availability [here](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25693770369937).

- Add other attachments if you want to or choose a template here

- Click on **Send ****quotations** 
 

## CloudSign activity

After you’ve sent your quotation(s) via CloudSign, there’s some interesting activity you can take a look at to follow up what happens to your quotation(s). Read everything about CloudSign activity [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693752155793-How-To-CloudSign-activity).

 

Next to that, you can choose to make a quotation either available or unavailable on CloudSign, or copy the CloudSign link. Read more [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693770369937-FAQ-Can-I-make-a-quotation-un-available-on-CloudSign).

 

## Deal amount vs [margin](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693029609233-How-To-Margin-and-markup-on-quotations)

*(Margin is only available in our *[*MOVE*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693707105297-Our-MOVE-package)*, *[*BOOST*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693667750929-Our-BOOST-package)*, *[*GROW & FLOW*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)* packages)*

 

Having multiple quotations per deal has an impact on both the **deal ****amount **and the **margin**.

When displaying the deal amount and the margin of the deal, the **average **of the amounts/margins in the open quotations will be taken into account. 

- Refused quotations are not included in the calculation. If there is no quotation accepted, then the deal amount is the average of all quotation amounts except refused quotations. 

For the deal amount, you’ll be able to view the following calculation per deal by clicking on **View ****calculation **in your deal details:

![The calculation breakdown for a deal's amount in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693711440145)

 

When one of the quotations gets accepted, the deal amount and the [margin ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693029609233-How-To-Margin-and-markup-on-quotations)will be that of the accepted quotation.
