# FAQ: Can I receive a copy when sending a quotation?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693572666769)

It might be handy to also receive a copy when sending a quotation to make it easier to follow up on your deal. You can activate the option 'Receive email copy when sending quotations' when navigating to** Settings **> **Deals and Quotations** >** Preferences**.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693564032657)

 

 

## Who will receive the copy of the quotation?

The setting 'Receive email copy when sending quotations' is a setting on account level. If the setting is enabled, the user sending the quotation will receive it in BCC.

If the user who sends the quotation is different from the responsible of the deal, we will also send it to the responsible user.

 

*Note: *You can also set a bcc for **all **outgoing email (and not only quotations) in your account if you want. Read more about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693959243409-FAQ-Can-I-set-a-bcc-for-all-outgoing-email).
