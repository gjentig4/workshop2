Teamleader Focus provides a standard selection of VAT rates, but it may be possible that you need to add additional rates.

 

The VAT rates available in your account by default are:

- 0

- 6

- 12

- 21

- CM (other EU member state)

- EX (outside EU)

- VCMD (other EU member states-facilities)

 

To add additional rates, follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Settings >** **Deals and Quotations >** **Preferences >** **Add VAT rate**.

- Add a unique code, a percentage and a description

The unique code is important to distinguish different VAT rates

- The percentage is the VAT rate

- The description will be displayed when you add a product to a quotation or an invoice, and choose the VAT rate

- The created VAT rate is added to the list of additional VAT rates under **Settings** > **Deals and Quotations > **Extra VAT rates.

 

The default VAT rate in your account when creating a quotation or invoice - at least for Belgium - is 21%. If you’d like to use a different default rate, [please contact support](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065) and let us know which rate you’d prefer.
