Absolutely. A quotation signed electronically is just as valid as if it had been signed in writing. As soon as the addressee electronically signs your quotation which was sent via Teamleader Focus, a legally valid agreement is established. 

 

The functionality in the Teamleader Focus tool, which makes it possible to digitally sign quotations, is fully in line with the European eIDAS regulation. For example, we have taken all reasonable measures to be able to establish the identity of the signatory and to prevent the sent document from being modified afterwards.

 

To make the legal validity of a signed quotation more prominent, we also store both the timestamp of the signature (shown in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)) and the IP address of the signer. Both will be displayed on your quotation. As this info is part of the customer's signature, you'll need to make sure the signature is added to the template of your quotation.

Some tips:

- For most commercial contracts, a simple electronic signature offers sufficient guarantees. For some weighty contracts, it is advisable to opt for a handwritten signature or an advanced or qualified signature (e.g. with e-ID).

- Do not create the impression that electronic means are the only option for the conclusion of a contract, in particular when the recipient is a consumer and not a professional. If the customer feels more comfortable signing the quotation in writing, please allow for this.

- Mention in your general terms and conditions or in your quotation that both parties agree to the electronic signature of the quotation and that such signature creates a valid agreement.

- Is the other party a legal entity (company, non-profit association, etc.)? Always check that the person who signs the quotation (electronically) also has the authority to represent that legal entity (e.g. the manager). Not everyone is allowed to conclude contracts just like that.

- Always confirm agreements with the customer by email. If there is a dispute about the contract, you can submit this correspondence together with the signed quotation to clarify any ambiguities.

- Always check how the other party has signed the quotation. It sometimes happens that the recipient places a cross or writes his/her name in the box where the signature must be placed. In such cases, ask the recipient to add his/her signature to the quotation. A signature has more evidential value, as it is harder to imitate.
