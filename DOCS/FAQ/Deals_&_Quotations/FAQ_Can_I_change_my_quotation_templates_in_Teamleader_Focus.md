Do note that a template needs to have been added before the option to adjust them appears in the settings. Haven't yet done so? Go to [your deal page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) and then go to the section 'Follow up on your deal'. Click on the 3 dots next to your quotation.
