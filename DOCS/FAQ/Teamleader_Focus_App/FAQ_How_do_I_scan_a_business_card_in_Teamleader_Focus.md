**Never lose an opportunity again: scan business cards you receive and insert the information immediately to your CRM!**

 

It’s actually really easy to scan a business card. The scanner is available in [our mobile app](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691083613201-FAQ-What-can-the-Teamleader-Focus-app-do):

- Click on **Menu Contacts**

- Click on the **+ **to add a new contact

- Click on **Scan business card**
**![The 'Add contact' form in the Teamleader Focus mobile app for creating new CRM contacts.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691542044561)**

- It is essential that the Teamleader Focus app has access to the camera of your phone. With it, you can take a picture of the business card. Teamleader Focus will recognise the information on it, but you can still make some changes and add or edit information.

- After you've added the contact, you can click on the + on the contact detail page and add a linked company, background information, deal or a file.
