# How To: Customise the view & buttons in the mobile app of Teamleader Focus

![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33367862501905)
The Teamleader Focus mobile app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.teamleader.focus&pli=1) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teamleader-focus/id6453793095)) offers two distinct views: the **classic view and the new view**. In this article, we’ll walk you through how the new view works and how to further personalise it via the quick access buttons. You can also revert to the classic view of the mobile app, allowing you to choose the view that best fits your workflow and needs. Read all about it in this article.
 

# New view

If you download our app for the first time ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.teamleader.focus&pli=1) or [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/teamleader-focus/id6453793095)), the new view is the layout you’ll see by default.

If you’ve been using our mobile app for a longer period of time and you download the latest version of our app, then the view will automatically switch to the new look as well.
 

This is what it looks like:

- This view has the **Home **button, the **Calendar **button and **Search **as main icons, with the **Menu **button on the right.

- 
**Upcoming today: **
Here you’ll see what’s happening today: which meetings or calls you have planned or which tasks are due.

- 
**Recent activities:**
Here you’ll find the items you’ve clicked on recently

- A **red dot **will appear next to **ongoing events.** For meetings and tasks, this dot will appear between the start and end time of the event. For calls the dot appears between the start time of the call and for 15 minutes after the start of the call.

- 
**Quick access:** By default, the ‘quick access’ menu on the top lets you quickly navigate to your Contacts, Companies and Meetings. 

Personalise the quick access icons by clicking on **Edit **in the top right-hand corner. Select the icons you want to see here e.g. ‘Deals’ or ‘Timer’. Choose up to 5 items and rearrange them in the order of your preference.

# Switch to the old view

If you’re more accustomed to the classic view of the mobile app, you can always switch back to the old view by following these steps:

- Open the app

- Click on **Menu **in the bottom right-hand corner

- Scroll down a bit

- Click on **Switch to classic view:**
**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/35294240565137)**

- The main icons in this view are the Calendar, Timer, Search and Menu. This view doesn’t contain a customisable quick access widget nor the red dots next to ongoing events.

- As for switching from the classic view to the new view, this is of course also possible by following the same steps above.
