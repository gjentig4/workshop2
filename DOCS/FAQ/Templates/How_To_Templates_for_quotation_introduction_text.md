# How To: Templates for quotation introduction text

![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/31592155327249)
If you often send quotations to your customers, it can be useful to have some standard messages ready to add to your quotation. That's where the templates for the quotation introduction text come in.

To create a default message for a quotation, follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Settings **> **Deals and Quotations**

- Scroll down the page to the "Templates for quotation introduction text" widget. 

- Click on the **+ icon.**

- Give your template a **name **in the next screen.

- Define your message. There are some variables you can use to personalise your message. For example, the variable #CONTACT_FIRST_NAME will always be replaced by the first name of the contact you are sending a quotation to, given that this information is available in the CRM. If you're sending an email to Jeroen De Wit, the variable #CONTACT_FIRST_NAME will be replaced with "Jeroen".

You can use different variables to personalise your message. Through the #NAME personalisation, for example, you can always start the accompanying text of your quotation with your customer’s name, regardless of the customer to whom you are sending the offer. You can set up different default emails depending on the nature of the offer.

- 
**Save **the template.

- Create a quotation and select your template in 'Introduction text'.
