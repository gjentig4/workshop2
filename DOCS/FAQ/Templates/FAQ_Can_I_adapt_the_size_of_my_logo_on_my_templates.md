# FAQ: Can I adapt the size of my logo on my templates?

Your logo is a key part of your brand identity, and having the right size on your templates ensures a professional look. The good news? You can easily adjust it by adding the right shortcode matching your desired size! Read on to learn how to customise your logo size effortlessly.
 

# Set up company logo

On a default template (no matter the document type), your logo is automatically generated and taken over from **Settings > Company information > click on company** **entity** > **Edit **> **Company logo.**

An example template for a quotation then looks like this:

On a template, you can also use the shortcode $LOGO$ to generate it anywhere you like on the Word document.

 

# Adapting the size of your logo

If the logo is too small, you can scale your logo up to better fit your design. Either use the shortcode:

- $LOGO_MEDIUM$ for a medium size logo (150% of the size of $LOGO$);

- 
or $LOGO_LARGE$ for a large size logo (200% of the size of $LOGO$). 
 

In the example below, you can find the three sizes of the logo compared to each other:

Know that instead of using one of these three shortcodes, you can also import an image straight to your Word document and adapt the size of the image in the document itself.

 

# Multiple logos

If you want multiple logos on your template, you should delete $LOGO$ from the template and insert both images directly in the template and upload it like that.
