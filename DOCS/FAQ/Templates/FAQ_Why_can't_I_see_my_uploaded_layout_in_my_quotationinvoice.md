# FAQ: Why can't I see my uploaded layout in my quotation/invoice?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691170803089)

You have just uploaded a new document layout of your quotation, invoice or other document type but you can’t find your new layout on your existing documents? This article tells you where to look!

When you changed something in your layout under **Settings **> **Document Layout** and you uploaded a new template, a preview of this document will be shown.

Your existing documents will however still have the previous layout. If you want to change them, you will need to regenerate the pdf of your documents to ensure that all changes are implemented. If your document is an invoice for example, you will need to:

- Navigate to the invoice in question.

- Click on the **pencil** next to ‘Contents’

- Click on **Save**.

The pdf will be regenerated and the changes will be made. This applies to all other document types.
