Want to set or change your signature in Teamleader Focus? Whether you're adjusting the size for a better fit or adding a new one, it’s easy to update. This guide will show you how to upload your signature and add it to your quotation template, as well as your customer's signature.

 

# Set your own signature

In case you want to set your own signature in Teamleader Focus, or change the signature of your quotation because e.g. the size of your own signature is disproportionally big compared to the signature of your customer on your quotation, you do the following.

- Click on your **user icon** in the top right-hand corner.

- Click on **My profile****.**

- Click on the **+ **next to 'Signature'.

- You need to upload your signature in the exact size that you want to see on your quotation. If you have no experience with resizing images you can find some tutorials over [here](http://www.wikihow.com/Resize-a-JPEG).

 

# Add signature to quotation

If you want to add signatures to your quotations - both your own signature and the signature of your customer -, add one of the following shortcodes to your quotation template:

- $DOCUMENT_SIGNATURE_AREA$: This will add both signatures to your quotation, the names and the following sentence: "Both parties agree to the content of the quotation and terms and conditions."

- $DOCUMENT_SIGNATURES$: Both signatures and the names of the responsible person and the client will be added to your quotation.

- $CLIENT_SIGNATURE$: This will only add the signature of the customer to your quotation.
