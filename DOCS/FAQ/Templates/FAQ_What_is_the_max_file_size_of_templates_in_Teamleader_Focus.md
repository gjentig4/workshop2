# FAQ: What is the max file size of templates in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691114417681)

 

When integrating your own [house style](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692647207057-How-To-Customizing-your-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus) into Teamleader Focus, you may encounter the error message that your file is too big.

 

Note that your .docx file has a maximum size of 4 MB. If you receive this message:

- Check the details of your file.

- More than 4MB? You have probably used big images or embedded special fonts in your template. In this case, we advise you to resize the images. You can easily resize them without losing image quality. Check [here ](http://www.picresize.com/)how.
