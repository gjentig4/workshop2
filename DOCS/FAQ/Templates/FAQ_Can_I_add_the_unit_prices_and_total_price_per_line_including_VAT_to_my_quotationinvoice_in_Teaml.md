# FAQ: Can I add the unit prices and total price per line including VAT to my quotation/invoice in Teamleader Focus?

By default, Teamleader Focus sets the unit prices and the total price per line excluding VAT on a quotation or invoice, but you have the option to change this to have them including VAT.

 

Therefore you need to go to **'Settings'** > **'Document layout**' and go for either 'Quotation' or 'Invoice', depending on which document you want to edit.

 

You download either our example template or your current template in case you set up your own template already.

You then need to replace the following shortcodes:

**To be replaced by:**
 

$PRICE_PER_UNIT_HEADER$
 
$PRICE_PER_UNIT_INCL_VAT_HEADER$
 

$PRICE_PER_UNIT$
 
$PRICE_PER_UNIT_INCL_VAT$
 

$LINE_TOTAL_HEADER$
 
$LINE_TOTAL_INCL_VAT_HEADER$
 

$LINE_TOTAL$
 
$LINE_TOTAL_INCL_VAT$
 

 

Beneath you see an example for a quotation template:
