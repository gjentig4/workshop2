Setting up templates for your documents is exciting but can seem difficult if you just got started with it. That is why we'd like to help you out with these tips and tricks!

 

But before we go deep in detail, we recommend that you have a look to the following articles if….

- You are looking for some inspiration for your templates. In our [Template Gallery](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693263841937-Welcome-to-our-Template-Gallery) you will find a number of functional templates that you can download and upload in your Teamleader Focus account

- You want to[ create a template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692647207057-How-To-Customizing-your-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- You have questions about the [settings of CSS code](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692055679889-How-To-How-can-I-edit-the-CSS-of-my-templates) to define colour, font or font size.

- You have issues trying to [add a specific font to your template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690938314513-FAQ-Can-I-use-my-own-font-in-the-layout-of-my-documents).

 

*Note regarding quotations: *[*When creating a quotation*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693612763409-FAQ-How-can-I-create-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus)*, you can also immediately preview the lay out and choose to hide certain items on your quotations like unit prices, (sub)totals or VAT. Do this if you don't want to change your complete template, but only want to apply these changes to certain quotations.*

 

Now that you know the basics, let's move on to some additional tips and tricks and some examples of templates!**

 

**Situation 1: You want to work with long descriptions on your quotation/invoice.**

Long descriptions allow you to introduce in the quotation/invoice a more detailed specification of the products/services you are offering.

 

Solution: Check [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691386604177-FAQ-How-can-I-add-a-long-description-to-a-product) on how to add a long description to your article, and then use the shortcode $LONG_DESCRIPTION$. Do note that this shortcode needs to be in the same cell as the shortcode $DESCRIPTION$.

 

 

**Situation 2: You want to work with subtotals on your quotation/invoice.**** **

Subtotals allow you to group the price of one or more products/services to.

 

Solution: If you want to display subtotals on your quotation or invoice, you'll need to work with the shortcode $SUBTITLE_TOTAL$. This shortcode needs to be on the same line as the shortcode $SUBTITLE$ **above** the articles. You can also download our template variation from our [Template Gallery](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693263841937-Welcome-to-our-Template-Gallery) (variation 5 for quotations and variation 4 for invoices).

 

**Situation 3: You don’t want to include in your quotation or invoice any of the mandatory shortcodes.**

Solution: In case you do not want to use an obligatory shortcode such as $TEXT_INVOICE$ or $QUOTATION_TEXT$, we advise you to change the colour of this shortcode into the background colour in order to make it invisible. 

 

Note that for the quotation text you will have to [change the CSS code](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692055679889-How-To-How-can-I-edit-the-CSS-of-my-templates) of the template as well.

 

**Situation 4: The text on the second page of my document starts in the header.**

Solution: You need to extend the size of the header. To do so, use the ruler at the left-hand side of your Word document.

**Situation 5: You do not work with quotations but rather with contracts.**

Solution: You don't need to use our quotations as actual quotations, they can also be used as contracts. You do, however, need to create some custom fields upfront, and adapt your template accordingly.

More information on custom fields can be found [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

We have also added an example template for a construction contract below. In this example, you could add some specific information in the quotation text, which will then appear instead of the shortcode $QUOTATION_TEXT$.

 

Note: You can still work with quotations in the traditional sense and send a contract to your customer as well within the same deal. To do so, create a [layout variation](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691627848977-FAQ-How-can-I-add-different-layout-variations-of-my-documents-e-g-quotations-or-invoices) for your quotations that you specifically use for contracts. Then, [create a second quotation in the same deal](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus) and choose the contract layout as a layout. You can send both documents to your customer this way. 

 

**Situation 6: You need to create quotations and invoices in different languages.**

Solution: This is no problem at all, [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691504811537-FAQ-How-can-I-change-the-language-of-a-quotation-or-another-document-in-Teamleader-Focus) can help you further.
