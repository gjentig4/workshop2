![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

When creating a [template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693263841937-Welcome-to-our-Template-Gallery) in Teamleader Focus, which you can do by clicking on** Settings **> **Document layout**, you'll have the option to add several shortcodes. The shortcode $CLIENT_INFO$ is one of them, and we will give you more information about this shortcode in this article.

 

After you've selected the specific type of document (quotations, invoices, ...) that you want to create a template for, click on **View shortcodes **to see all the available shortcodes for that type of template. 

You'll see that there are several shortcodes to add information about your customer:

The shortcode $CLIENT_INFO$ is a combination of multiple other shortcodes. When using this shortcode, the following items about your customer will be mentioned: 

- Name of the company/contact

- Street and number 

- Zip code and city

- Province (for Spanish and Italian customers)

- Country

- VAT number

 

You can also display this information by using the following combination of shortcodes:

If you don't want to show all the information generated by the shortcode $CLIENT_INFO$, we advise you to remove this shortcode from your template and to use the separate shortcodes mentioned in 'View shortcodes'. 
 

**Note**

Important to know is that the $CLIENT_INFO$ shortcode does not display the VAT number if it's used on a quotation or an order.
