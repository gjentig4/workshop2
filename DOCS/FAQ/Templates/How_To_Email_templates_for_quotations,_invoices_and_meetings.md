# Why use templates?

Templates or default emails are pre-formulated messages that can be sent within a few clicks. This helps you to save time if you often have to write the same type of messages. Templates can be made for meetings, sending quotations and invoices, automatic reminders and thank you messages. There are a number of preset templates in Teamleader Focus already, but you can always adapt these to create even more personal communication.

## Email variables

For every template email in Teamleader Focus, there are some variables you can use to personalize your message. For example, the variable #FORENAME will always be replaced by the forename of the contact you are sending an email to, given that this information is available in the CRM. If you're sending an email to Jeroen De Wit, the variable #FORENAME will be replaced with "Jeroen".  

![A list of available variables for document or email templates in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691226130449)

 

These variables can always be found at the bottom of the screen when composing your template.

 

Here is an overview of the different types of email templates that Teamleader Focus offers and that will be discussed:

 

- Email templates for quotations

- A default message when sending invoices

- Regular email templates

- A default message for meetings

- Automatic invoice reminders

 

## Email templates for quotations 

You can create email templates for sending the quotation to your customer.

Important here is the variable** #LINK**. If you use this variable in your template email, this will be visible for the customer as **a link to **[**Cloudsign**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign), where the quotation can be checked and signed online. The #LINK parameter will be replaced by the sentence "View quotation online" in your email.

If a quotation is accepted via Cloudsign, you’ll get a notification in Teamleader Focus. An accepted quotation will automatically change your deal phase into "Accepted".

 

*Notes: *

- The email template that is selected by default when sending a quotation is the first one in alphabetical order. To change which template appears first, add prefixes like “A”, “B”, or “C” to your template names (e.g. “A – Standard quotation”).

- Add an attachment to the quotation template to have it included automatically with every quotation you send.
 

## A default message when sending invoices

You can customize invoice templates through **Settings **> **Revenue**. Scroll down to "Email templates for invoices" and edit an existing template or create a new one by clicking the "**+**" symbol. 

 

You can use invoice templates for sending out invoices for the first time, or as reminders for when an invoice is overdue.

 

## Regular email templates

A contact or company email address is always clickable in Teamleader Focus. When sending emails to these addresses, you can also use predefined templates. This might come in handy for a sales organisation who has to send a lot of the same emails to leads, for example.

 

To create these email templates, navigate to Settings > "Email". Click the "**+**" button next to "Templates for regular emails" and you’re able to compose a default message. Using variables, you can always personalize these messages.

Once you are finished creating default emails, you’ll find them when composing an email after clicking an email address in the CRM.

 

Note: When you're composing the emails, you might want to use new alinea's. To start a new alinea, press enter. To start a new line, press shift + enter.

## A default message for meetings

Go to **Settings** > **Calendar**. Scroll down to the "Meeting invitation templates" widget and create a template or default message yourself by clicking the "**+**" symbol.

 

Do you want to send the default message to a meeting? Create a meeting in Teamleader Focus and add the contact to the meeting. Now, you are given the option of sending the email. There you can select which default message you want to use.

## [Automatic invoice reminders](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691492744849-FAQ-How-can-I-send-a-reminder-of-an-invoice-in-Teamleader-Focus#:~:text=X%20days%20ago.-,Automatic%20reminder,-(This%20feature%20is)

You can send out some of these messages as automatic reminders when an invoice remains unpaid. You can do this in the widget below "Email templates for invoices", "Automatic reminders". Here you’ll be able to select the messages you created and set a time frame in which the reminder has to be sent. You can do this multiple times, with multiple messages.
