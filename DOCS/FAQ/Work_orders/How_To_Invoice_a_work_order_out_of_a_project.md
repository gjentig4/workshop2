As you might know, finished tasks or meetings linked to your project end up as time tracking in that project. It's however also possible to add a work order to your project and register it as time tracking. In this article, you can discover how to invoice that same work order via your project.

 

## Link the work order directly to the project and invoice it

- Create a project and a first phase 

- 
[Create a work order](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690927285777-How-To-From-work-order-to-invoice) and immediately link it to the right customer, project and phase
Add some extra products if needed

- Go to the project and click on **Time tracked **on the work breakdown page. The work order will be registered like this:

Extra costs like extra products you added to the work order will be added to the invoice as a separate article line. You can see these extra costs when you invoice them.
