## How can I fill my Teamleader Focus wallet?

There are two different options to top up your credits. Both happen via either SEPA direct debit or credit card.

- **Automatic refill**

Define a minimum amount of credits to have in your Teamleader Focus wallet. As soon as the amount of credits drops below this point, your wallet will be refilled automatically.

- **Manually buying new credits**

You can buy a cash pack starting from €5 up to €1000.

## What can I do with my Teamleader Focus credits?

There are multiple ways to spend your Teamleader Focus credits:

 

- **Scan your expenses**

[After you've uploaded expenses to your Teamleader Focus account](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34057221210001-How-To-Add-scan-expenses-in-Teamleader-Focus), you can choose to scan them (either manually or automatically). Scanning essentially means that all information will be fetched from your file and filled out automatically in the relevant fields of your expense. 

There’s a maximum of 100 free scans every month. At the start of every month, the counter in the top right-hand corner of your expense overview resets to 100. 

If you go over the limit, every scan will cost €0.10 and this will be deducted from your wallet.
 

- **Trends Top Data**

Trends Top is a website offering valuable company information, such as telephone numbers, a contact person, the sector in which they are active, etc. If you have a Trends Top account, you can integrate your Trends Top data with Teamleader Focus. Whenever you add a new company, you can add any data available on that company through Trends Top. This data can be purchased using your Teamleader Focus wallet.

 

Notes:

- As this is a Belgian website, this option is only available for Belgian companies.

- Enable Trends Top in **Settings** > **Users** to be able to buy and ignore data.

- If you have an account with export rights, i.e. the Marketing or Business formula (see [website](http://trendstop.knack.be/en/trendstop-pricing.aspx?int_campaign=direct&int_content=nav-right)), you don't need to pay twice for the same data. Just go to your Marketplace and establish the integration between your Teamleader Focus and your Trends Top account.

 

- **Exporting invoices to your accountancy program**

We offer different kinds of integrations with accountancy programs.
