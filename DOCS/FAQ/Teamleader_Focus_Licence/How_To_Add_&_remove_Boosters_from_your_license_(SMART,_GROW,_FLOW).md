# How To: Add & remove Boosters from your license (SMART, GROW, FLOW)

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696125056401)

 

Are you on a [SMART, GROW or FLOW plan](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)? Then you can enhance your account by adding Boosters with additional functionalities to your license, or you can remove functionalities by removing Boosters from your account. Find more information here.

 

## What

The main reason we introduced Boosters are flexibility. You decide whether you want to add extra features to your basic package. The goal? Running your business in one place. The SMART, GROW and FLOW packages are an ideal base, but you may lack certain functionalities to enable your ideal way of working.

 

We have the following Boosters in store for you:

- Lead capture

- Planning

- Work orders

- Project management

- Advanced insights

- Shared inbox

 

With the Boosters, you only pay for the functionalities you actually use.
