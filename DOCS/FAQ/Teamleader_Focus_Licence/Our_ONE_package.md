![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695459467281)

*! This article is only relevant if you have one of our older pricing plans GO, MOVE or BOOST. If you have one of our newer plans (SMART, GROW, FLOW) the distribution of the features is different. Find more information [here](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25696098299537).*

The ONE package is the central tool for your one-(wo)man business, with all the essentials in one place. Read more about the features in this package here.

We offer the ONE package especially for solo businesses, like freelancers or self-employed people looking to build a professional image towards (potential) customers or wanting to improve their own brand. The package has **only one user account** and **combines all the basics** you need to sell, bill and organise your work.Explore all features of this package in the following list.

## CRM

With the CRM functionality, you can manage all your contacts & companies and easily divide them into specific categories. You can add tags to further differentiate between your customers, and use these for email campaigns, using external integrations like Mailchimp. The file management included in ONE gives you the ability to save PDF’s and other documents related to contacts or companies, so you have a full overview of your customer’s situation in one place.

## Quotations

Did you meet some new leads and are you ready for the next step? Start creating some quotations. Print them, send them via email, or use our online platform CloudSign to have your customers view and sign quotations online - which are signed twice as fast as sending a quotation the “normal” way.

## Deals

A deal is crucial in your sales process. You have one standard [sales pipeline](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25696017218705) and you can define it by adding custom deal phases so you never lose track of an opportunity. Creating a quotation for that deal is child’s play. You can even use predefined templates to save time.

## Lead capture Booster

Engaging with customers online is really important in this day and age. That’s why we have our Lead capture Booster in Teamleader Focus. Schedule and meet with your customers online, on top of all the other functionality our tool already brings. [Read all about what it is and how to activate it.](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25694859794577)

## Invoices

When you’re working, you want to get paid. That’s why creating and sending invoices is a simple process within Teamleader Focus. You can even create advance invoices or register partial payments. Billing in another currency? No big deal! Want to get your invoices paid faster? Then add a QR code to your invoices which customers can scan with their bank app. Or use Invoicecloud, and decrease the average days to payment with 8 days! That will also help you reduce the need for manual invoice reminders. You can even send out thank you messages to customers that paid on time. If you made a mistake on a booked invoice, you can always credit it.

*Note that you can only make 15 invoices a month in this package*

## General features

All of our packages come with some standard features that can make your life easier. Importing data such as contacts and companies for example. If you already have a list of those, you don’t need to waste time manually inputting them. Same goes for exporting data from your Teamleader Focus account. And after inputting data, it would be a shame if you can’t find anything easily. That’s where a global search function comes in handy. 

Another time saver are templates. Add them once, and you’re set. Drafting emails or other documents like quotations and invoices will only take seconds. 

Every company has their own ways, we know. That’s why you can add custom fields to your account. They allow you to add extra information that’s not available by default.

Other general features include a recycle bin to retrieve accidentally deleted contacts or companies or creating discounts for quotations.
