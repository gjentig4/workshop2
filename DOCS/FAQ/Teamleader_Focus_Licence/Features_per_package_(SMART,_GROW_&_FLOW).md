# Boosters

Let's take a moment to highlight the Boosters of Teamleader Focus. The main reason we introduced these are flexibility. You decide whether you want to add extra features to your basic package with these Boosters. The goal? Running your business in one place. The SMART, GROW and FLOW packages are an ideal base, but you may lack certain functionalities to enable your ideal way of working.

 

That’s why we have the following Boosters in store for you:

- Planning

- Lead capture

- Work orders

- Project management

- Advanced insights

- Shared inbox

 

With the Boosters, you only pay for the functionalities you actually use. Admins can add Boosters via the licence page. Let us briefly introduce the current Boosters.

 

## [Planning](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25696175894929)

The Planning Booster is your key to streamlined management. This Booster optimises scheduling, maximises resource usage, and helps you plan for the future. With Teamleader Focus’ established Planning Module, your coordination becomes very easy, ensuring your team's time is used efficiently and your tasks are well-organised and adaptable. Assigning the right team member to each task becomes a walk in the park because you have real-time insights into your employees’ availability and capacity.

## [Shared inbox](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690708387601)

Time to introduce the next Booster: Shared inbox. Which allows you to manage customer queries from one practical inbox. The big advantage of Shared inbox is that you collect all questions in one place and immediately see which customer created the ticket. If the sender's e-mail address is not known, a new contact is created. Can't answer the ticket right away? Then you create a task for yourself or a colleague.

- Communicate directly with your customer

- Add an internal note for a colleague

-
