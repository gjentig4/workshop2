# FAQ: Why am I being logged out from Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695347961233)

 

If you’re reading this article, then you’ve probably been logged out from Teamleader Focus without specifically wanting to. Read this article to understand why.

 

You may have received this error message:

 

*You have been logged out because your login was used to access your account from a different browser or device.*

 

It’s not possible to access your account from multiple browsers or devices at the same time. According to [our Terms of Service](https://www.teamleader.eu/legal/terms-of-service-teamleader-focus), every user in Teamleader Focus should have their own personal user account. This means that **each user account belongs to one person only and may therefore not be shared with and reused by other persons** (Art. 5.2.). That’s why we don’t support users to use credentials of other users to log into someone else’s user account.

 

If your colleagues want to keep using Teamleader Focus to work smarter, you can [buy new user licenses for your account. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692210395793-How-To-How-do-I-buy-a-new-user-licence-for-my-Teamleader-Focus-account)

 

Is this not the reason why you’re being logged out? Then maybe you’ve been logged out because your session expired. This has to do with the login timeout set up in your account, which you can read more about [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692088895505-FAQ-Can-I-set-an-automatic-timeout-logout).
