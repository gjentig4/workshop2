# Our MOVE package

![Stylized illustration of a person jumping with calendar, timer, and clipboard icons.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693666569361)

*! This article is only relevant if you have one of our older pricing plans GO, MOVE or BOOST. If you have one of our newer plans (SMART, GROW, FLOW) the distribution of the features is different. Find more information *[*here*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)*.*

 

Our MOVE package is the solution for you if you want to kick your business up a notch. Read everything about this package here!

 

Let’s start with our MOVE package credo:

 

*“**Increase **your **efficiency **by **automating **as much as possible. Become the best in **managing ****your ****projects**, **track ****time **and **automatically ****make **them appear on **your ****invoices**. **Automation **is key!”*

 

Do you need a little bit more than the basics and are you interested in **automated ****actions **like invoice reminders or automated sales follow-up? Do you additionally need to manage **projects**, work with **tasks**, **calls **& **meetings**, need **work ****orders **or do you have to **track ****time**? Then this could be the package for you!

 

Perfect for businesses like:

- Building contractors

- Small agencies 

 

Explore all features of this package in the following list.

 

 

## CRM

With the CRM functionality, you can manage all your contacts & companies and easily divide them into specific categories. You can add tags to further differentiate between your customers, and use these for email campaigns, using external integrations like Mailchimp. The file management gives you the ability to save PDF’s and other documents related to contacts or companies, so you have a full overview of your customer’s situation in one place. 

 

What’s extra in the MOVE package, is that you can better define access rights to CRM or deal information. A user with limited access will only see contacts, companies or deals that they are responsible for.

## Deals and Quotations

A deal is the starting point of your quotation and the sales process. You can define up to two tailored sales pipelines in your account and add custom deal phases so you never lose track of an opportunity. Creating a quotation is child’s play. You can even use predefined templates to save time. Print them, send them via email, or use our online platform CloudSign to have your customers view and sign quotations online - which are signed twice as fast as sending a quotation the “normal” way.

The MOVE package adds the option for Orders, Order Confirmations and Delivery notes. You can also set an expiry date on your quotations. But what’s even better, is that you can automate your sales process by automatically creating a task, meeting or call when a deal enters a new phase.

## Calendar

You have access to a dashboard which shows you all open or (over)due tasks, meetings and calls for the previous or upcoming seven days. Customise your account further by defining call outcomes for your sales colleagues, or add different work types for tasks. 

 

The MOVE package also makes it possible to have a certain cost linked to these work types, so invoicing spent time becomes a whole lot easier. Be sure to check out below the different ways to track time and how to invoice that time.

 

All of these calls, tasks and meetings will also be shown in a calendar so you can keep track of your schedule.
In MOVE, you can even restrict access to each other's calendars if you want.

## Lead capture Booster

Running a business without online meetings is hard to imagine in this day and age. That’s why we have our Lead capture Booster in Teamleader Focus. Schedule, meet and engage with customers online, on top of all the other functionality our tool already brings. [Read all about what it is and how to activate it.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster)

 

## Projects

The MOVE package is ideal for companies that manage quite some projects. Creating projects in Teamleader Focus is an easy process. You can break down complex tasks into manageable components, set deadlines, assign responsibilities, and track progress—all in one place.

## Revenue

When you’re working, you want to get paid. That’s why creating and sending outgoing invoices is a simple process within Teamleader Focus. You can even create advance invoices or register partial payments. Billing in another currency? No big deal! Want to get your invoices paid faster? Then add a QR code to your invoices which customers can scan with their bank app. Or use Invoicecloud, and decrease the average days to payment with 8 days! That will also help you reduce the need for invoice reminders. You can even send out thank you messages to customers that paid on time. If you made a mistake on a booked invoice, you can always credit it.

 

The keyword in MOVE is automation. And that reflects in billing as well: you can create automatic invoice reminders, so you take the stress of manual follow-up out of your hands. If you periodically bill the same amount over and over again, you can use subscriptions to save you some time.

## Products

Creating or uploading a list of products can speed up your quotation and invoicing process a ton. These products will be suggested once you start adding a new line on a quotation or invoice. Teamleader Focus also offers some limited stock functionality, which tracks the amount of products you have left based on your booked invoices. You can also include suppliers and a unit cost, which helps to define your margin. If you have a good relationship with certain customers, you can create dedicated price lists with slightly different prices for the same products.

[Read all about it here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34775080480913-FAQ-What-are-the-key-features-of-the-Advanced-insights-Booster)

 

## General features

All of our packages come with some standard features that can make your life easier. Importing data such as contacts, companies and products, for example. If you already have a list of those, you don’t need to waste time manually inputting them. Same goes for exporting data from your Teamleader Focus account. And after inputting data, it would be a shame if you can’t find anything easily. That’s where a global search function comes in handy. 

 

Another time saver are templates. Add them once, and you’re set. Drafting emails or other documents like quotations and invoices will only take seconds. 

 

Every company has their own ways, we know. That’s why you can add custom fields to your account. They allow you to add extra information that’s not available by default.

 

Other general features include a recycle bin to retrieve accidentally deleted contacts or companies, creating discounts for quotations or adding multiple email addresses to send documents from.
