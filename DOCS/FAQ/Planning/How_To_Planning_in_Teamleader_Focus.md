## Benefits

The Teamleader Focus Planning can help you improve your way of working:

- 
**Check capacity:**

Efficiently **identify available personnel** and resources to optimally use your valuable time

- Assigning the right team member to each task becomes a walk in the park because you have **real-time insights** into your employees’ availability and capacity. 

- 
**Scheduling**: accurately schedule tasks in the near future but also in the distant future.
*Note*: Our planning module differs from our [calendar module,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25085616010257) as the planning only offers an overview in which you can plan and reschedule tasks. You can’t see at what time a certain task is planned.

- 
**Flexibility**: always adapt your schedule when unexpected changes arise. This helps keep your work on track without overworking your team. 

 

## What

You can find **Planning **in the navigation on the left. 

- Here you will find a weekly overview of all your colleagues/employees.

- If you click on **Assignees **in the top left-hand corner you have the option to filter by people, but also by [teams](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690706850321-How-To-Creating-a-team-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- If you click on the **cogwheel **at the top, you can set your **planning ****preferences**.
![The Planning preferences dialog box in Teamleader Focus for customizing the calendar view.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/26105437733649)

 

You can choose to **display ****weekends **or not by turning the slider ‘Show weekends’ off or on

- 
You can choose to display the **work type colour of your tasks **in your planning (cf. [Settings > Calendar > Work types](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691899451153-FAQ-Can-I-add-extra-work-types))

- 
You can choose to** show capacity as a percentage** or not
![Time tracking progress bars showing daily and weekly capacity percentages in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/26105452249233)
 

- You can also select what **info **you want to see **displayed on a planning card**. The title of the task will always be the title of the planning card, but when you view a task in the planning you can define which information you see below the name of the task. There are three options, but note that this meta data will only be displayed if the planned time is 2 hours or more: 

Customer name

- Project title

- Work type

 

- If you are clicking/scrolling through the planning, you can always return to the current date by clicking on **Today**.

 

- In addition, you can **adjust the visible time period **of the planning by zooming in and out on the plus and minus at the top of the page. You can zoom out to a maximum of 4 weeks.

 

After you've customised the view to your preference, it's time to plan tasks.

- Click on** Plan tasks** in the top right-hand corner.
![Toolbar for planning tasks with a duration selector and 'Plan tasks' button in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696193805201)

- First of all, you can filter on which tasks are displayed here by: 

Searching for it in the **search ****bar**;

- Defining the range of the **due date of the task**;

- Filtering on **projects, assignees or work types.**

*Note*: You cannot [create tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691951764497-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-task-in-Teamleader-Focus) in the planning module. You have to create the task via the calendar or by clicking on the plus and then "task" at the top.

 

- After you’ve found the right task, **drag and drop **it into the planning of the right person on the right day.

If you filled out 6 hours when creating the task, the task will immediately be scheduled for 6 hours.
*Note*: This will only happen if there is enough availability on that day for that user, otherwise it will plan however much is available.

- If you didn’t define the duration of the task, it will automatically be planned for 1 hour. 

- Tasks that are already fully planned won’t show up in the sidebar to plan tasks. They will show up with the label ‘Fully planned’ when searching for them.

- You can also plan tasks over multiple days by clicking on the task in the bottom right corner and dragging it horizontally across days. Your availability or the availability of your colleagues will also be taken into account.
![Teamleader Focus planning board showing tasks assigned to a user and the 'Convert to timesheet' link.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28017452388881)

 

- It's also possible to **add new tasks directly from your planning **by clicking on the plus icon on a day. A task side panel will open where you can add the details of your task.
![Adding a new time tracking entry in the Teamleader Focus timesheet view](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/29310543883793)
 

After you've planned tasks, this has an impact on your capacity.

- At the top left of the planning you have the **totals bar**. Here you can see how much **planned vs unplanned time** you have in total for all your colleagues/employees for the duration of the visible time period on your screen. 

- Next to the totals bar, you have the visualisation of the planned and unplanned time for **every separate day.****![Weekly time tracking overview showing daily totals and progress bars in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696181378833) **

- Under the totals bar, you have the visualisation of the planned and unplanned time for **every individual colleague/employee.**![A user profile snippet showing time tracking progress for 'Sara'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696170174609)

 

 

*Notes*:

- You can also plan a task directly from the **project task side panel,** instead of starting from the planning module:
![The task side panel in Teamleader Focus showing the 'Plan in planning' link within the Planning section.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/26105452255889)

- If you’ve overplanned someone, their totals bar for that day will turn red.
![User time tracking and capacity overview showing tracked hours versus total weekly and daily goals.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696193955345) 

- The **weekly planning options **are different if you’ve also set a [week schedule ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691870457873-FAQ-How-can-I-set-a-week-schedule-in-Teamleader-Focus)for someone. 

Here, you can indicate if there are days when someone is **not ****available **and that day will be **shaded **in the planning. 

- If you plan a task for that person on a day that they are not available, you’ll receive the following warning:
![A 'No available capacity' warning dialog when planning a task in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696155589009)

- If you click on **Plan ****anyway**, then the capacity bar will turn red. 
 

- If you have a [BOOST ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693667750929-Our-BOOST-package)or [FLOW ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)licence, you can also determine your **days off.** That day will be **displayed in grey**. If you try to plan a task that day, the capacity bar will turn red as well. 

 

If you **click on a task,** you can see on which date and how long the task is scheduled, the customer name, the project title and work type. 

- 
If you click on the **pencil**, you can **edit **the planned time.

There’s also the option ‘**Suggest ****time**’. Clicking on it will automatically schedule the full duration of the task (if there’s still enough time available for that day for that user of course), or the remaining duration.

 

- 
If you’ve already planned time for the same task on another day, that amount of time will be visible between **brackets**. In the following example, the total task duration is 10 hours, but you’ve already planned two hours on another day (+02h00):
![The 'Edit planned time' dialog box in Teamleader Focus for adjusting task duration.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696194117777)
*Note*: The planning module is not a calendar so you can’t see at what exact time a task is planned, only the duration. Check the paragraph below for more information on the link with the calendar module.
 

- 
If you click on the **three dots you **have three options:

View task details: A task side panel opens in which you can edit the task details.

- Track time: Immediately add time tracking from a planned task.

- 
Remove planned time: By clicking on this, you delete the planned time in the planning, but not the actual task itself.
*Note: you can also view these three options by right-clicking on a task in the planning.*

 

To **r****eschedule a task** and move it to another colleague or to another day, you can always **drag and drop** the task to someone else/another day.

 

Tasks, meetings and calls turn a **lighter shade** if they are in the past.

 

**Completed tasks are visually indicated** with a check mark in the Planning, both for past and future tasks: 
![User capacity and time tracking overview showing daily tasks and weekly progress.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696181820817)

 

## Link with the calendar module

The planning module is closely linked to the calendar module as the actions you perform in your planning have an impact on your calendar and vice versa:

- After you’ve planned all the tasks to your liking in your planning, it’s up to your team members to schedule the tasks in their calendar. The **tasks **are **not scheduled in the agendas for a specific time frame,** but when they go to their **calendar**, they will see the amount of planned tasks per day on top. The availability bars below a certain day will fill up as they take all planned tasks, meetings and calls from the planning into account. [Read more about the capacity bars here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692599972369-FAQ-What-do-the-coloured-bars-in-the-calendar-stand-for)
![Weekly calendar view in Teamleader Focus showing task distribution and workload.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696166192017)By clicking on 'x task', a user will be redirected to the day view where **every individual co-worker** has the possibility to check them off immediately or to **click and drag them into the daily schedule** for a specific time frame.

 

- If you** schedule a task in your or your colleague’s calendar,** it will automatically **show up in the planning** as well. And when you extend the scheduled time of a task in your calendar, the scheduled time of the task will also be extended in the planning.

 

- 
When navigating to the task detail page, you can **choose **to plan the task in your planning via **Plan in planning** or Schedule it in your calendar via **Schedule in calendar. **
**![Detailed view of a task in Teamleader Focus with planning and scheduling options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696194331665)**
*Note: as mentioned before, scheduling a task in your calendar also immediately displays it in your planning as well. Planning a task in your planning however won't schedule it in your calendar for a specific time.*

 

- 
If you work with an [**external ****integration **for your calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690957593745-How-To-Integrate-calendars-with-Teamleader-Focus) such as Google Calendar or iCloud, items can also be **copied into the planning**. [Similar to what happens in your calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691415928721-FAQ-Why-do-I-only-see-grey-blocks-in-the-agenda-of-my-colleague), the boxes will be **greyed ****out **in your planning with the label '**busy**'. The scheduled time of this activity will also be included in the capacity bar so it will affect your availability.

To enable this, go to **Settings **> **Planning > Preferences > Calendar events from integrations affect planning**. *Note that this setting is an account-wide setting, meaning that when enabled, all users will have their planning affected by items from their calendar.* 
![Planning preferences toggle for calendar integration impact](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696141892369)

## 

Link with timesheets

You can also quickly convert your planning to timesheets for an entire period, saving you time and hassle. [Read this article to find out](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/26653504659089-How-To-Convert-your-planning-to-timesheets-in-Teamleader-Focus) how this can further boost your productivity and efficiency.

## 

Access to planning

You can also change the planning access for everyone:

- Go to **Settings **> **Users **> **three dots** next to every user in your account.

- You see **Planning **and **Access**. Next to disabling the complete module, you can also limit access. You have 3 options:![Access rights settings for the Planning module in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696141948305)

 

 

## Notes

- 
**Calls **scheduled via the calendar are **visible in the planning. **The duration of a call is 30 minutes by default.

- 
**Meetings **scheduled via the calendar are also **visible in the planning.** The duration of the meeting is taken over and is also included in the total bar.

- If you want to **reschedule a call or meeting**, you have to do it **via the calenda**r because you cannot move a call or meeting in the planning module.![A tooltip warning stating that meetings cannot be replanned or rescheduled via the calendar.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696170808209)

- 
**Tracked time doesn’t show up** on your planning card, and it’s also not possible to register time on a task via the planning.
