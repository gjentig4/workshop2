In the calendar's week view you'll see a bar below each day of the week. This shows your total availability for that day, based on the amount of [hours per week](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691870457873-FAQ-How-can-I-set-a-week-schedule-in-Teamleader-Focus) you have set. The bar will fill up based on the tasks, meetings and calls you have planned in your agenda for that day.

The availability bars also take all planned tasks, meetings and calls from your planning into account. So even if a task is not exactly scheduled in your calendar, but it is due on that day and planned via the planning, your availability decreases.
