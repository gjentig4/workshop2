![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

When you create [a meeting type](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694496632593-How-To-Create-a-meeting-type-for-your-personal-booking-page-as-a-team-admin) or [a contact form](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695775141649-How-To-Contact-forms-and-how-to-create-them) you can set up all the details an add some extra questions to get more information from your leads and clients. Information from the questions will be sent to your Teamleader Focus CRM.

 

In this help article you can read which question types you can add and which data is sent to your CRM.

# Ask questions 

When setting up questions in your meeting type, you will have three basic questions that are required:

- First name

- Last name

- Email

*Note: you can always edit the name of the label.*

 

If you want to map these to e.g. your contact in Teamleader Focus, make sure to check the box next to 'Create new contact'. Optionally, select which tag(s) need to be added to your contact.![The 'Ask questions' configuration panel for setting up lead capture forms in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694465860753)

 

You can do the same for if you want to add a company or a deal in Teamleader Focus. Just check the boxes next to 'Create new company/deal'.

- When you check the box next to 'Create new company', a question 'Company name' will be added and mapped to your Teamleader Focus CRM by default.

- Note that either 'Create new company' or 'Create new contact' needs to be checked if you want to be able to check the box next to 'Create new deal'.

 

Next to these default questions, you can also add custom questions. These custom questions provide you with more information on your client, e.g. a telephone number, a subject to discuss, …

- Fill out the question label

- Change the type of question

- Optionally make the question required below if you think it's useful

- Choose which field in Teamleader Focus you want to link the answer to

- Check the preview on the right side![Form editor for adding a telephone number question to a Teamleader Focus lead capture form.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694465939729)

 

Save the question so it’s added to your meeting type. You can now also add a second custom question. 

![A form builder interface showing a required telephone number question and an 'Add question' button.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694414656017)

You can also change the order between the basic questions and the other custom questions you might add.
