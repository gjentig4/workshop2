# FAQ: Which team meeting settings can a non-admin of the team change?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695162666897)

 

A team exists of admin and non-admin users. The team admin can create meeting types for the entire team, while non-admin users can only create personal meeting types. The admin can add multiple team members to a meeting type and set all the default settings.

But what can you change as a non-admin in this meeting type?

 

# What does a team meeting type look like?

You can recognize a team meeting type by the people assigned to it. If more than one image or circle with initials is visible, it's a team meeting type.

# Which parts are editable for a non-admin team member?

As a non-admin team member you will notice that most parts of a team meeting type are not editable for you. Only team admins will be able to edit those parts. Only the availability part will be editable for non-admin team members.

 

A non-admin team member can change all his **availability** settings. Because those settings are more on a personal basis. [In this help article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694606512401-How-To-Create-a-meeting-type-for-your-personal-booking-page) you can read more about those settings.

 

Only the team Admins can change the settings in:

- Meeting type details

- Availability (of other team members)

- Summary

- Powerful extensions
