Planning meetings can sometimes take more time than the meeting itself. Use the Scheduler to have your customers easily plan meetings with you!

 

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

There are 2 ways to connect your Google calendar:

- [The onboarding flow](#1.-The-onboarding-flow)

- [Scheduling settings](#2.-Scheduling-settings)

 

Once you're connected you can also send calendar events to Teamleader Focus. Read more about it at the end of the article.

- [Sync calendar events to Teamleader Focus](#Sync-calendar-events-to-Teamleader-Focus)

# 1. The onboarding flow

To set up your booking pages you will have to follow a few steps, which can easily be done in our scheduling flow.

Go to [Scheduling](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/scheduling/welcome/) to get started and click on **Connect ****your ****calendar**.

## 1.2 Set up the calendar settings

 

- Select the '**Calendars to check for availability**' to avoid double bookings. You can check multiple calendars if necessary.

*Important note:* Make sure that the events in your external calendar have the status 'Busy' instead of 'Free'. Only then will those time slots be blocked from your availability, and clients won't be able to book a meeting during your 'busy' time slots.

- Select the '**Calendar to write events in**' to show in which calendar new meetings should be booked in.

# Sync calendar events to Teamleader Focus

Now that you've connected your Google Calendar to the Lead capture Booster, you might want to sync your calendar events to your Teamleader Focus calendar as well. In order to do this, you'll need to set up the integration between the Lead capture Booster and Teamleader Focus. Follow these steps:

- In the Lead capture Booster, go to **[Settings > Integrations > Teamleader.](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/integrations/teamleader/)**

- In these settings, check the box next to "Create a calendar event through Teamleader Focus":
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694254512401)

- When enabled, a calendar event is created in Teamleader Focus and written through to the online calendar that is configured in Teamleader Focus. To make sure these events are still visible in your online calendars (Google, Microsoft, ...), you need to set up the calendar synchronisation in [the Teamleader Focus marketplace.](https://marketplace.focus.teamleader.eu/eu/en/category/calendar)

 

## How does it work?

- The calendars that are checked on availability are based on what you selected in the Lead capture Booster (cf. above) and are based on the availability in your Google Calendar (not on your availability in Teamleader Focus).

- New events created through a booking in the Lead capture Booster will be visible in both your Google Calendar and in the Teamleader Focus calendar.

- If a different calendar to write events to is selected in the Lead capture Booster versus in the Teamleader Focus Marketplace, then the events will be written to the calendar you've selected in the Marketplace.

- Guests will still receive a confirmation mail but will not receive a calendar invite anymore.
