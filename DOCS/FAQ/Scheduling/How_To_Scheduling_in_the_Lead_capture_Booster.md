## What

Let clients or leads book a meeting with you themselves based on time slots in your calendar that you choose, even when you're not online. Put a booking link on your website, set up different meeting types and have them immediately assigned to an available colleague. You keep control of your schedule and still maintain an open-door policy. Easy, efficient, but still approachable and customer-friendly.

 

An automatic booking link on your website is not just useful for your existing customers. It can easily transform your website into a lead magnet: potential customers can very easily contact you and schedule a meeting right away. So sit back, relax, and watch the deals pour in - you'll still have to do the actual work afterwards, of course....

 

## Setup 

After you've activated and set up the Lead capture Booster in your Teamleader Focus account, automatically a Teamleader Focus integration is set up there. You can find this integration in **Settings > Integrations > Active integrations > Teamleader Focus. ****![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695099420305)**

 

All information entered while booking meetings with you or your team will be sent to your Teamleader Focus account. New contacts are created in Teamleader Focus when someone books a meeting for the first time. [Read this article to discover everything about this integration.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694959400081-How-To-The-Teamleader-Focus-integration-in-the-Lead-capture-Booster)

 

To set up your booking pages you will have to follow a few steps, which can easily be done in our scheduling flow. Go to [Scheduling](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/scheduling/welcome/) to get started and click on **Connect ****your ****calendar**.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695099502353)

 

## Connect your calendar

*Note*: In the integration settings with Teamleader Focus, the check mark next to 'Create a calendar event through Teamleader Focus' is checked by default: this means that all bookings will be synced to your Teamleader Focus agenda by default.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695084072081)You still have to [connect your external calendar (Google, iCloud, Exchange,...) to your Teamleader Focus account](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690957593745-How-To-Integrate-calendars-with-Teamleader-Focus) though if you then want your Teamleader Focus meetings to be synced to that calendar.

 

### Set up the calendar settings

 

- Select the '**Calendars to check for availability**' to avoid double bookings. You can check multiple calendars if necessary.

*Important note: *Make sure that the events in your external calendar have the status 'Busy' instead of 'Free'. Only then will those time slots be blocked from your availability, and clients won't be able to book a meeting during your 'busy' time slots. 

-

Happy scheduling!
