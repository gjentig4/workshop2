# How To: Connect your iCloud calendar with Lead capture Booster

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694358082321)

Planning meetings can sometimes take more time than the meeting itself. Use the Scheduler to have your clients easily plan meetings with you!

 

There are 2 ways to connect your iCloud calendar:

- [The onboarding flow](#1.-The-onboarding-flow)

- [Scheduling settings](#2.-Scheduling-settings)

 

Once you're connected you can also send calendar events to Teamleader Focus. Read more about it at the end of the article.

# Sync calendar events to Teamleader Focus

Now that you've connected your iCloud Calendar to the Lead capture Booster, you might want to sync your calendar events to your Teamleader Focus calendar as well. In order to do this, you'll need to set up the integration between the Lead capture Booster and Teamleader Focus. Follow these steps:

- In the Lead capture Booster, go to [**Settings > Integrations > Teamleader.**](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/integrations/teamleader/)

- In these settings, check the box next to "Create a calendar event through Teamleader Focus":
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694372437265)

- When enabled, a calendar event is created in Teamleader Focus and written through to the online calendar that is configured in Teamleader Focus. To make sure these events are still visible in your online calendars (Google, Microsoft, ...), you need to set up the calendar synchronisation in [the Teamleader Focus marketplace.](https://marketplace.focus.teamleader.eu/eu/en/category/calendar)

 

 

## How does it work?

- The calendars that are checked on availability are based on what you selected in the Lead capture Booster (cf. above) and are based on the availability in your iCloud Calendar (not on your availability in Teamleader Focus).

- New events created through a booking in the Lead capture Booster will be visible in both your iCloud Calendar and in the Teamleader Focus calendar.

- If a different calendar to write events to is selected in the Lead capture Booster versus in the Teamleader Focus Marketplace, then the events will be written to the calendar you've selected in the Marketplace.

- Guests will still receive a confirmation mail but will not receive a calendar invite anymore.
