# How To: Style the text of email templates with Markdown in the Lead capture Booster

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695490348305)

The Lead capture Booster offers a lot of customising options for meeting rooms and scheduling. Next to advanced styling options, you can also customize the text in several places. But how do you style that text?

 

Easy, by using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This help article will guide you on where and how to use Markdown to customise text in the Lead capture Booster.

# Where to customize text with Markdown in the Lead capture Booster?

You can customize the text for meeting templates and for the custom text strings in the waiting room.

 

## Meetings

[Meeting type](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/scheduling): customize the confirmation, reminder and cancellation emails of a specific meeting type.

*Note: Markdown is not supported in the calendar invite template!*

 

## Custom text strings

Edit the custom text strings in the [Customization page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/team/customization/). You can customize the message that a knocking guest will see when **the host is present **in the meeting room and when **the host is not present** in the meeting room.

 

# How to style text with Markdown?

Below we will explain the basics of the Markdown language which you can use in the Lead capture Booster. You can find a more extended guide [at this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Please note that not all the options in that guide will work in the Lead capture Booster (eg. images)!

 

- 
**Headings**

You can use headings by adding one or more hashtags (#) and a space before the text:

To add **an unordered list** you have multiple options. You can use - item, + item or * item below each other. Add a space after the symbol.

4. **Links**

In order to add a link, enclose the link text in brackets [text] immediately followed by the URL in parentheses (URL). You can make the link bold or italic by adding the asterisks/underscores before the brackets and after the parentheses.

You can add a horizontal line by adding three asterisks, hyphens or underscores:
