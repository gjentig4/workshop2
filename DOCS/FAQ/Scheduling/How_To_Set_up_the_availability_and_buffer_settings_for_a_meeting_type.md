In this guide you can read more on how to set up the availability and buffers for a meeting type. 

 

# 1. Go to the advanced settings

When you create a new meeting type or edit an existing one, you will immediately see the Meeting type details. Scroll down until you see **the slider Show advanced settings** and activate it.

**Additional invitees**

In the advanced settings of the meeting type, you can give the guest the option to[ invite up to 6 additional invitees to the meeting.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696130908433-How-To-Invite-additional-invitees-to-your-meeting) Fill in the number of additional invitees (max. 6), so the guest will see this on the booking page. 

![Advanced settings for additional invitees in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694446254609)

E.g. If you fill in 2, the guest will be able to invite 2 additional guests, meaning you will have a meeting with 4 participants (you, the guest and 2 additional invitees).

**Meeting room template**

If you have created meeting room templates to have meeting rooms prepared in advance, you can also use them for booked meetings. Select the preferred template for this meeting type.

**Cancellation and rescheduling **

If you want to allow guests to cancel or reschedule a meeting, you will need to enable this checkbox*. The guest will then have a link in the confirmation and reminder mail to cancel or reschedule the meeting.

![Setting to allow guests to cancel or reschedule a meeting in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27153243259793)

**Note: This will be automatically enabled for meeting types created after July 2024. For meeting types created before or during July 2024, you will need to manually enable this.*

 

**Bookable range** defines the range for booking this meeting type and can be a maximum of 90 days. You will see 3 default options: 

- 30 days

- 60 days

- 90 days

 

If you want a different range for this meeting type, click on custom and type the amount of days. E.g. 45 days.

![The 'Bookable range' setting field in Teamleader Focus scheduling.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694674864401)

In **Booking start date** and **Booking end date**, you can define a specific period in which people can book a meeting. This can be used in combination with the minimum buffer and the max range of days in the future.

 

*Example: You have a product promotion in March and want people to book only between the first and last day of March. Make sure your max range covers the whole period if you want people to be able to book from today.*

 

![Date input fields for Booking start date and Booking end date](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694690785169)

 

**Show availability in increments of 'x minutes'** gives the possibility for your clients to book every '15, 30 or 60 minutes'. If you pick 30 minutes and your day starts at 9AM, your clients will be able to book a meeting at 9AM, 9.30AM, 10AM, …

 

![Setting to choose calendar availability increments in 15, 30, or 60 minute intervals.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694674951057)

 

**Booking buffer** defines the amount of working hours before a booking can be made. By default it will show the next working day, this means that same day bookings are not possible. You can also select 4 hours, 2 hours or Custom.

 

If you click 'Custom' you will be able to set an amount of hours before a booking can be made. E.g 16 hours.

![The Booking buffer setting field in Teamleader Focus scheduling](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694703330833)

 

Your working hours are defined by your availability!

 

*Example 1: Your working hours are set from 9AM to 5PM and your custom buffer is set to 3 hours. When a client visits your booking page at 11AM then the earliest time slot they can book is 2PM that same day.*

* *

*Example 2: Your working hours are set from 9AM to 5PM and your custom buffer is set to 3 hours. When a client visits your booking page at 4PM then the earliest time slot they can book is 11AM the next day.*

 

*Example 3: Your working hours are set from 9AM to 5PM and your custom buffer is set to 24 hours. When a client visits your booking page on Monday morning at 8AM then the earliest slot they can book is 9AM on Thursday (calculated if you work 8 hours a day each day).*

 

 

The **Meeting buffer (before) **and **Meeting buffer (after)** give more information on when the meetings can be booked. If you want no other bookings 15 minutes before and after a meeting you fill in 15 minutes in both boxes.

 

You will see 3 default options: 

- No buffer

- 5 minutes 

- 10 minutes

 

If you want a different buffer for this meeting type, click on custom and type the amount of minutes. E.g. 30 minutes![Configuration settings for meeting buffers before and after scheduled appointments.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694677817873)
