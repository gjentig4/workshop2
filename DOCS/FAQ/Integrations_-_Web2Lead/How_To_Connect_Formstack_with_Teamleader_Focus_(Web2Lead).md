Web forms are a useful way to collect customer data. Use Web2Lead to automatically add all information leads enter to your Teamleader Focus account. This way, you can use customized questions on your web forms and make sure all data is registered properly. 

 

And there's more: for each form that is filled out, a new deal will be added to your CRM. This enables you to follow up on your leads quicker. All you have to do is add a Formstack contact form to your Wordpress, Drupal or Squarespace website. 

 

*Before starting, we would like to offer you the choice between our standard Web2Lead-integrations and our integration with *[*Zapier*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693119585425-How-To-Integrate-Teamleader-Focus-with-Zapier)*. The second one could offer you some important advantages. Read more about this in the *[*following article*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693169806481-How-To-Link-an-online-form-to-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead-integrations)*.*

 

## How to set up your Teamleader Focus integration with Formstack?

Navigate to [Teamleader Marketplace](http://marketplace.teamleader.eu/) or click on your profile picture in the right top corner > **Integrations**. Here you can use the search bar to find the Formstack integration. If you want to discover other Web2Lead integrations, click on the "Web2Lead" category in the sidebar. To integrate Formstack with your Teamleader Focus account, choose **Add**. Once you've made the connection, choose the provider you want to use to create the form. 

 

## Creating a form with Formstack

Formstack works in a similar way like [Wufoo](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691807372433-How-To-Connect-Wufoo-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead). 

 

When you create a new form you will see the different fields available on the left. On the right, the preview window enables you to see what the form will look like.

## Linking new forms with Teamleader

Once you've created your form, link it with your Teamleader Focus account. Go to Integrations >  Add > Settings > Connect new form and enter the form name. Below, you have the option to assign a co-worker, who will receive a notification whenever the form is filled in. Also, you can add a tag to new leads to [segment them easily ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)and enable the option to create a new deal for every submitted form.
