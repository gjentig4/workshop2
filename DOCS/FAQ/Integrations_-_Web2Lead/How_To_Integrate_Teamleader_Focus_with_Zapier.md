# How To: Integrate Teamleader Focus with Zapier

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693097344017)

 

Over the past few years, Teamleader Focus has integrated with a lot of different applications in the process of becoming an all-in-one tool. The next big step in this process is our participation in one of the biggest software integrating tools: Zapier.

 

## What is Zapier?

 

Zapier is an online automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as Gmail, Slack, MailChimp, and over 1,000 more. You can connect two or more apps to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration. Move info between your web apps automatically, so you can focus on your most important work. It's easy enough that anyone can build their own app workflows with just a few clicks.

 

## Glossary

 

### Zap

A Zap is an automated workflow between your apps. For example, you may have a Zap that saves your Gmail attachments to Dropbox and another Zap that saves emails that you star in Gmail to a text file. Zaps consist of at least two parts: a Trigger and one or more Actions.

### 
Trigger

A Trigger is the event in an app that starts the Zap. Once you set up a Zap, Zapier will monitor the app for that event. For the "Save Gmail attachments to Dropbox" example, you can receive a lot of emails through your Gmail account, but the Zap is not triggered until an email contains an attachment.

 

The available **triggers **for Teamleader Focus are:

- Created deal

- Paid invoice

- New contact

- New company

- Won deal

 

The available **actions **for Teamlader are:

- Link a contact to a company

- Create contact

- Create company

- Find contact info

- Create deal

- Find company info

### Action

The Action is the event that completes the Zap. For the Gmail to Dropbox Zap example, the action is saving the Gmail attachment to Dropbox.

### Task

 

Each piece of data you run through your Zap counts as a task. That means if your Zap adds 100 emails to Dropbox automatically, your Zap just performed 100 tasks. Every task your Zap performs is another task that you don't have to do manually. It's important to keep in mind the number of tasks your Zaps run, because it helps determine what Zapier plan is best for you.

 

### Examples of zaps with Teamleader Focus

## Price tag?

 

Zapier is free up until a number of connections. However, if you plan on creating multi-step zaps, use premium apps, etc. you can choose to transfer to a paying license. The big advantage here is that you get to use license to create zaps between other apps than just Teamleader Focus. Find out all about pricing and plans [here](https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans).
