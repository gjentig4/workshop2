# How To: Integrate Teamleader Focus with Make

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693972145169)

Over the past few years, Teamleader Focus has integrated with a lot of different applications in the process of becoming an all-in-one tool. Make offers an integration with many more tools in one go.

 

***Note****: You can always ask our advice with regards to whether a certain flow should be possible between Teamleader Focus and an external app via Make. However, for all technical questions, feature requests and more detailed information, please direct yourself to Make [via the 'support' button](https://marketplace.focus.teamleader.eu/be/en/detail/integromat/integromat/329f01). They will be able to further assist you, as they manage the integration and corresponding logs.*

 

## What is Make?

Make is an online automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as Gmail, Microsoft 365 apps, MailChimp, and over 1,000 more. You can connect two or more apps to automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers to build the integration. Move info between your web apps automatically, so you can focus on your most important work. It's easy enough that anyone can build their own app workflows with just a few clicks.

 

## Glossary

 

### Scenario

A scenario is an automated workflow between your apps. For example, you may have a scenario that saves your Gmail attachments to Dropbox and another scenario that saves emails that you star in Gmail to a text file. Scenarios consist of at least two parts: a Trigger and one or more Actions.

 

### Trigger

A Trigger is the event in an app that starts the Scenario. Once you set up a Scenario, Make will monitor the app for that Trigger. For the "Save Gmail attachments to Dropbox" example, you can receive a lot of emails through your Gmail account, but the Scenario is not triggered until an email contains an attachment.

 

Some examples of **triggers **for Teamleader Focus are:

- Created deal

- Paid invoice

- New contact

Some examples of **actions **for Teamleader Focus are:

### Action

The Action is the event that completes the Scenario. For the Gmail to Dropbox Scenario example, the action is saving the Gmail attachment to Dropbox.

### Operation

Each piece of data you run through your Scenario counts as an operation. That means if your Scenario adds 100 emails to Dropbox automatically, your Scenario just performed 100 operations. Every operation your Scenario performs is another task that you don't have to do manually. It's important to keep in mind the number of operations your Scenarios run and how many Scenarios you have, because it helps determine [which Scenario plan is best for you](https://www.integromat.com/en/pricing).
