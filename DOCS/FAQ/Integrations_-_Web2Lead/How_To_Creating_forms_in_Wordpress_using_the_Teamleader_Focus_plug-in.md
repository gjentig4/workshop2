The user friendly interface helps you to setup forms for capturing leads in no time - no coding skills required. Convert your website visitors into leads immediately, create deals and fill your sales funnel in Teamleader Focus easily.

 

*Example of an automated flow:*

- *A visitor leaves his or her details and message via your WordPress form.*

- *A new contact, company and/or deal is automatically created in Teamleader Focus.*

- *Sales contacts this person, reducing the time between subscription and first contact.*

- *Send your prospect a quotation which he or she can consult and sign online.*

- *Convert the signed quotation into a project or an invoice.*

8. In case you create several forms, then you need to add a certain shortcode [teamleader id=X] to any Wordpress page or blog post. The shortcode can only be added once to the form, otherwise the form won’t work, and leads won’t be added.
