Web forms are a great way to collect relevant information about your leads. Instead of mailing back and forth for their details, your contacts can just fill in a short form on a landing page, which is saved to your CRM and that’s it. Not only does this mean one less thing to worry about, the quality of your leads will improve also. After all, they voluntarily provide you with their details!

 

With one of Teamleader Focus' Web2Lead integrations, contact data is automatically sent to your CRM, allowing you to store it in an efficient way. We offer several Web2Lead options, most of which are compatible with your Wordpress site because of the underlying technology called Custom Forms. These are:

 

- [Jotform](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691809384721-How-To-Connect-Jotform-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead)

- [Wufoo](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691807372433-How-To-Connect-Wufoo-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead)

- [Formstack](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691775121297-How-To-Connect-Formstack-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead)

 

*Before starting, we would like to offer you the choice between our standard Web2Lead-integrations and our new integration with *[*Zapier*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693119585425-How-To-Integrate-Teamleader-Focus-with-Zapier)*.
