![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691809761041)

 

Teamleader Focus offers you several ways of adding contacts and companies to Teamleader Focus but the most efficient way is probably the import of an excel or a csv file.

## Prepare your file

First of all you need to check your excel or csv file. In attachment, you find an [example file for an import of companies](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/article_attachments/25691810725905).

## Doing the import 

After your excel or csv file is prepared, simply follow the steps to fill up your CRM.

- Navigate to **Contacts** or **Companies** depending on what you want to import.
Note: You do have the option to import both of them in one go as long as they are in one sheet. Check [here ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691225593361-FAQ-Can-I-also-import-the-related-company-when-importing-contacts-into-Teamleader-Focus)for more information.

- Click on **Import** in the right hand corner.

- Choose **Via file or copy/paste**.

- In the next pop up window you go for **Choose File**.
Note: You can only upload XLS, XLSX or CSV files.

- Choose the right file from your storage.

- Match the columns with the right fields.

Notes:
 

Teamleader Focus does match some columns automatically. However, you should still check every column and match it accordingly. 

- Make sure that every available value in the dropdown menu is only chosen maximum once.

- Fill in standard values in case a cell of a compulsory value is empty. 

Country

- Language

- Account manager (in case of an import of companies)

- Click on “**Preview**”. You can proceed to step 9, but it might be that you need to solve some error messages first.

Check whether you really matched each value maximum once.

- Check whether you filled every cell of the mandatory fields

Contacts: “Last name”

- Companies: “Name”

- Check [the allowed values in your excel file again](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691845208465-FAQ-What-values-are-allowed-for-importing-contacts-or-companies).
