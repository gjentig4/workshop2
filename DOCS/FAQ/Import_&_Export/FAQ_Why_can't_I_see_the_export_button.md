If you can't see the "Export" button in your account, this means you don't have export rights. The admin of your Teamleader Focus account can grant you those. Click [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) for more information on the role of an administrator.

 

To grant someone export rights, the administrator will need to navigate to **Settings** > **Users **> click on **the name** of a colleague > 'Permissions' > 'General' > Enable the toggle 'Export'.
