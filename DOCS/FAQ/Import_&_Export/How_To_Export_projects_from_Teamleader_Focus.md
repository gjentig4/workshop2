# How

To export your projects, follow these steps:

- Go to **Projects**

- 
On this overview page, click on **Export to Excel** next to the "Add Project" button.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33058333447953)
 

- 
The next screen ‘Generate project Excel export’ opens. Export all projects, or further refine here which kind of projects you’d like to export.
*Note:* A warning banner will appear when the selected filters result in zero exportable results.

Columns: choose the ‘Basic columns’ to export or click on [+ Create template to select your own columns](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25698010805521-FAQ-How-can-I-select-the-fields-that-need-to-be-exported). Know that you can also select custom field columns for inclusion in the export. You can also add specific line item columns, e.g. Billing method (line), Price (line), Type (line) - to indicate the item type (a task, a material, etc.).

The basic columns are:

Project number, name & status

- Customer

- Owner & assignees

- Start date & end date

- Time tracked

- Billing method

- Price, Budget & Budget spent* (Only for users with access to project financials)*

- Cost & Margin *(Only for users with access to project costs)*

- 
Amount (un)billed *(Only for users with access to project financials)*
 

- 
Select a start and/end date, or select the owner of a project. If you have [multiple company entities](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) you can also filter on these.

- 
If you select a filter from your ‘Saved filters’ you can choose to export only the projects in a certain filter instead of all of them. [Read all about saved filters here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695851989905-How-To-The-projects-overview-in-Teamleader-Focus#Project-status)

- Export projects to individual sheets: if you enable this checkbox, you also have the option to export each project into individual sheets for better organisation. In your Excel file you'll then find a main Projects sheet, a Projects (with lines) sheet, and individual sheets per project.
 

- 
Click on **Export**. Your export will start in the background. You’ll receive a message in the bottom right-hand corner when the export is ready.

- 
**Download **the file. Important to know is the following information:

The names of the project columns will be translated according to the language of the user account you export the data from. Know that data you entered yourself (project names, custom fields) won’t be translated.

- 
Date/time formats will be in the [date/time format of your company entity.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693633724049-FAQ-Can-I-set-a-different-date-format-on-documents)

- 
Currency symbols will be taken over from the currency of your account.
 

## Note

The purpose of this export functionality is mainly to give you the ability to export multiple projects at once. Keep in mind it isn’t possible right now to also include line items per project in the project export. You can however always download an elaborate timesheet report per project.
