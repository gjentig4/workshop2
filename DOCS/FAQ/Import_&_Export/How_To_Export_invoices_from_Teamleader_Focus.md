## Export to PDF

A third option is to export your invoices to PDF. A ZIP file will be created which you can download and which contains all invoices separately in PDF.

**Note:** The maximum number of invoices you can export in one batch via the pdf export is 250. If you want to export more invoices, you need to create separate segments to split the export.![Error message in the Bulk export invoices dialog showing an export limit exceeded.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695234448145)
