# FAQ: What are the available bookkeeping integrations in Teamleader Focus per country?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

Teamleader has a link with several accountancy tools. We can divide them into two categories:

- 
**Two-way sync**: some accountancy integrations are two-way synced, meaning Teamleader Focus sends information to the software but also receives information. These tools are all online software.

- 
**Export only**: Teamleader Focus has a one-way integration with a number of (mostly offline) accountancy tools. In this case, only information from Teamleader Focus can be imported into the software.

Here is an overview of the accountancy software Teamleader Focus is able to link with and in which countries they are available:

[In our Marketplace](https://marketplace.focus.teamleader.eu/be/en/category/bookkeeping) you'll find more information on other bookkeeping tools we integrate with.

Note that you cannot use two of these integrations at the same time, as Teamleader Focus only allows one accounting integration per account. If you have [multiple company entities](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) then using Yuki for one company entity for example and Exact Online for the other is not possible.

 

**Export only:**

 

These are a number of offline tools. Unfortunately, most of these are only available in Belgium right now. In the future, this list will be expanded over multiple countries.
