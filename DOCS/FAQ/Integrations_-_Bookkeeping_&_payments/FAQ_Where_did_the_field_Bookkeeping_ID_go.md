# FAQ: Where did the field Bookkeeping ID go?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693991954065)

Trying to figure out where the Bookkeeping ID field has gone? As part of a new roll out we’ve made some improvements.

Some quick points of info to help you get acquainted with the changes:

- The new name of the field is External ID

- If you have an active bookkeeping integration, this field will automatically be available under Company Edit.

- In case you need to turn this field on manually, you can do so by navigating to **Invoices > Export > Export to bookkeeping program > Manage External IDs > Turn the Manually Editable slider on**
