Sync financial data from Teamleader Focus to your accounting software using the Accounting connector Booster. By activating this Booster, invoices, credit notes, expenses, customers and suppliers are automatically sent to your accounting tool. This reduces manual work, avoids double entry, and keeps your bookkeeping up to date. This article covers what the Booster is, how to add it to your license and finally how to set up the integration per company entity.

# Features of the Accounting connector Booster

The Accounting connector Booster makes bookkeeping effortless by automatically syncing your Teamleader Focus data with your accounting software. No manual exports, no duplicate entries, just accurate and up-to-date financials.
 

With this Booster, you can:

- 
**Connect with Exact Online, Octopus or Yuki.** 

- 
**Keep your accountant up to date automatically** with these core functionalities:

Sync outgoing invoices and credit notes (“Revenue”) to your integration

- Sync incoming invoices and credit notes (“Expenses”) to your integration

- Create and update customers and suppliers in your accounting tool 

- 
**Reduce errors and administrative work**: ledger accounts and VAT rates are linked correctly per company entity. 

- 
**Save time with flexible syncs**: run syncs manually or let them happen automatically in the background. 

- 
**Focus on your business**: spend less time on bookkeeping and more on what really matters.
 

Moreover, activating the Booster is simple and affordable. You pay a flat fee of **€5 per month** per account in a yearly license, and €6 per month/account in a quarterly license. 
If you have [multiple company entities](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) you don’t have to pay extra for each entity you connect as the Booster **covers up to 4 company entities.**
 

# Add the Booster to your license

The Accounting connector Booster is available for all packages and can be added to your license by [an account admin.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) 

Add the Booster to your account by following these steps:

- Click on your **user icon** in the top right-hand corner

- Click on [**Manage license**](https://focus.teamleader.eu/web/settings/subscription)

- In 'Your Boosters', click on **Add** next to the Accounting connector. 
![Pricing and feature overview for the Teamleader Focus Accounting connector add-on.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261729594129)
*Note: it’s not possible to start a trial for this Booster, it will be added to your subscription immediately.*
 

- In the next screen, click on **Buy now **to gain immediate access to the functionalities of the Booster.
![Checkout screen for adding the Accounting connector Booster in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775595921)
 

- Proceed with the checkout and confirm your purchase. The Booster is now added to your licence and you'll be charged pro-rata for the remainder of your billing period.
 

The Booster can also be removed from your license following the same logic as the other Boosters, which is [described in this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696169462161-How-To-Add-remove-Boosters-from-your-license-SMART-GROW-FLOW)
If that’s the case, the active accounting integrations in the account will be deactivated and removed as of the next renewal date.

 

# Set up an integration 

After adding the Accounting connector Booster you can set up an integration between your account and **Exact Online, Octopus or Yuki. **
 

! Before you start, make sure you have:

- 
[**Admin rights**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) in Teamleader Focus

- 
**Access to Settings **in Teamleader Focus

- 
**Access to the accounting tool** you want to connect with Teamleader Focus.
 

To set up an accounting integration, follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings > Company information**

- Click on the **name of the company entity **you want to set up the integration for

- Click on the tab **Accounting**
**![Accounting integration setup within the Company entities settings in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261729596177)**
 

- Click on **the integration of your choice** and authenticate with the accounting tool login. In this example we’ll show the steps for Octopus, but note that the main steps are very similar for all integrations. Some fields can differ a bit per accounting integration. 

- A new screen will open with the following information:
![The first step of connecting Octopus accounting software to Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775598481)
 

Fill in the required information such as **username** and **password** and click on **Connect.**

- Choose an accounting folder or division and click on **Submit**.

- After successfully connecting, you get redirected back to Teamleader Focus where you can complete your integration setup by clicking on **Complete setup.**

![Integration setup screen for Octopus in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775600273)
 

- In the next screen in ‘Integration details’, start by filling out a **start date**. This defines the date from which Teamleader Focus will start synchronising your invoices and credit notes.
![The 'Integration details' step in the Octopus accounting software setup wizard in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261729599633)

Define the **journals** for outgoing/incoming invoices and for outgoing/incoming credit notes. We filter on the accepted types (incoming/outgoing) in your accounting tool and filter out the unaccepted ones, so you can easily choose these without making mistakes. 

- In ‘**Synchronisation**’ you can choose to synchronise the invoices/credit notes automatically. This synchronisation will then run in the background automatically every night. 
! **Note: **We advise setting the automatic synchronisation only after the connection has been successfully established and you went through the next steps.

- In **‘Accounts for discounts’** you can optionally set which ledger accounts in your bookkeeping tool should be selected for discounts.

- In **‘Link VAT codes’**, [you can optionally link the VAT rates from Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691580977681-How-To-Adding-additional-VAT-rates) to the VAT codes of your bookkeeping tool.

- The final step is ‘**Set ledger accounts’**. Here, you link the VAT rates in Teamleader Focus to the corresponding ledger accounts in your accounting software. These ledger accounts will then be used automatically for invoice lines with that VAT rate.

If you enable the slider ‘Set ledger accounts for existing invoice lines without a ledger account’, any existing invoice lines that don’t yet have a ledger account will automatically be updated with the linked one.
![Mapping a VAT rate to a ledger account and enabling automatic ledger assignment for invoices.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261729600017)

- After following these steps, you’ll see the overview page of the integration, where you can always access and edit the settings.

- If you return to **Settings** > **Company** **information** > your company entity > **Accounting**, the **status** of the integration will be shown here:
![The Accounting tab in Teamleader Focus settings showing a connected Octopus integration.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775603217)

If the setup was successful the status will be ‘Connected’.

- If the setup was not completed the status will be ‘Configuration needed’.

- During the setup the status will be ‘Connecting’ and will change to ‘Connected’ when the connection has been established.
 

## Multiple company entities

If you have multiple company entities, note that the same setup needs to be done for every company entity. Note that even different accounting tools (from the available 3 that are mentioned above) can be connected per entity. E.g. You can use Exact Online for company entity A and Yuki for company entity B.
You can also use one of our 3 built-in integrations for one entity and another from [the available integrations in our Marketplace](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/eu/en/category/bookkeeping) for another entity, depending on how that integration is built. [Be sure to contact us in case of additional questions.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065)
 

# Synchronisation after setup

After establishing the connection, it’s time to sync the information from Teamleader Focus to your accounting tool.
 

To repeat, there are 7 types of items that are synchronised to your accounting tool:

- Ledger accounts: these are fetched from the accounting tool so that they can be used on invoices in Teamleader Focus, and are synced back to the accounting tool

- Contacts and companies linked to outgoing/incoming invoices and credit notes

- Outgoing invoices: only booked invoices are synced

- Outgoing credit notes

- Suppliers linked to expenses

- Incoming invoices (via Peppol): 

Only **approved** incoming invoices via Peppol are synced

- 
If you are also uploading receipts or non-Peppol invoices in your Expenses module manually or via OCR, then these aren’t synced to your accounting tool via the Accounting connector. You can however set up that these other approved expenses are automatically sent to your bookkeeping tool email address. [Read all about that here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357221963409-How-To-Send-expenses-to-your-bookkeeping-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Incoming credit notes (via Peppol)
 

A synchronisation can be started from five places:

- The invoices page: click on the double arrows next to the title ‘Invoices’:
![Navigation tabs for Invoices, Forecast, and Subscriptions in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775603729)

- The expenses page: click on the double arrows next to the title ‘Expenses’:
![The Expenses module header with a recurring icon in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775605137)

- The credit notes page: click on the double arrows next to the title ‘Credit notes’:
![Navigation tabs for Invoices, Forecast, Subscriptions, and Credit notes in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775607057)

- Via **Settings** > **Company** **information** > **Company** **entity** > **Accounting** > the **double** **arrows** next to the integration:
![Accounting integration status for a company in Teamleader Focus showing Octopus connected.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261729605649)

- Via the accounting detail page (**Settings** > **Company** **information** > **Company** **entity** > **Accounting** > **Click** on the integration): here you click on the **Sync **button in the top right-hand corner
![The Octopus accounting integration settings page in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775608081)
 

- Depending on the page from which you start the sync, the sync is started for **all connected company entities** (via invoice, expense or credit note page) **or for a specific company entity** (via Settings > Company entity). 

- If a sync starts, all items will be synced (so only syncing outgoing invoices for example is not possible).

- If a sync is actively running, the **sync button will be disabled** in all places for every user.

- 
**Every user who has access to a page can also start the sync:** e.g. someone who has access to expenses can start the sync from the expenses page. 
All documents will be synced even if that person doesn’t have access to invoices for example.

 

Once the first synchronisation has completed successfully, you can return to the integration settings to enable **automatic synchronisation**. This will run every night automatically without any user intervention, although manual synchronisation is still possible if needed.

- Go to **Settings** > **Company** **information**

- Click on your **company** **entity** > **Accounting**

- Click on the **integration**

- Go to the tab **Synchronisation**

- 
**Enable the slider **next to ‘Synchronise outgoing and incoming invoices and credit notes automatically’
![The synchronisation settings for the Octopus accounting integration in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775610129)
 

# Notifications and troubleshooting

In the **Settings** of your integration > **Synchronisation** tab, you'll find a **synchronisation** **history** of the past 7 days. This log shows the status of every sync and shows if it was successful or not. An error can occur if for instance the credentials of your accounting tool have changed or if you no longer have access to the tool, which prevents the synchronisation from completing.

![Synchronisation settings and history for invoices and credit notes in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775611409)

*Note: if the status of the sync is ‘Success’, this does not mean that all of your documents were synced, some could be skipped. Read on to find out more about this. *

For each company entity you sync, you’ll receive an **in-app notification** (via the notification bell in the top-right corner of your account) and an **email** once a **manual synchronisation** is finished. 
![Notification showing the results of an accounting synchronization with Octopus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42268385819537)

![Notification showing the results of an accounting synchronization with Octopus in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42267061224209)

- Note that if automatic sync is enabled (cf. above), no notification will be sent to avoid sending too many notifications. 

- Only the user who started the manual synchronisation will receive notifications.

- The notification shows how many items were synchronised and, if any issues occurred, how many documents were skipped.
 

If there’s an **issue** with an invoice or credit note during synchronisation, the entire sync will not be blocked. Only the items with an error will be skipped.
Example: If you have 10 invoices that should be synced, and the 7th one has e.g. missing ledger accounts, then invoice 7 will be skipped while invoices 8-10 will be synced.
 

To find out where the synchronisation might go wrong and which documents were skipped, you can easily **see which documents have already been synced to your accounting tool** from the Revenue overview or Expenses overview.

- 
**Invoices and credit notes**: add the **Booking number** column via the cogwheel in the bottom-right corner of the invoices or credit notes overview. Documents without a booking number have not yet been synced.
![The Invoices overview table in Teamleader Focus showing a list of generated invoices.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42267061226129)

- 
**Expenses**: synced expenses get the status **Sent to bookkeeper**. You can add this column to the expenses overview to quickly identify which expenses have not yet been sent to your accounting tool.
![Table view of incoming invoices in Teamleader Focus with bookkeeper status.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42267061227153)
 

As mentioned, if there’s an issue you’ll receive an in-app notification about this or you’ll see this in the sync history. If it’s unclear what the issue is or how to solve it, [please contact us. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065)
 

# Editing or deleting the integration

After setting up the integration, you can easily edit certain settings by going to **Settings > Company information > Company entity > Accounting** and clicking on the integration.
Keep in mind that changing information in the **Details** tab can affect how the integration works, so proceed with caution.

Delete an integration by following the above steps to edit the settings of the integration. Click on the **three dots **in the top right corner and click on **Delete integration:**

**![Octopus integration settings page showing the sync button and delete integration option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/42261775612305)**

# 

Coming soon

- In a few weeks we’ll be syncing the payment status of invoices, expenses, and credit notes from your accounting integration back to Teamleader Focus.

- In a later update, we’ll also improve the synchronisation itself by giving you clearer insights into when the last sync ran and what may have gone wrong during a sync.

- 
We will add more accounting integrations in the future and make it available for other countries too.
