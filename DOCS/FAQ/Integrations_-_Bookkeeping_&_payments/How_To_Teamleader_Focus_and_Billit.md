# How To: Teamleader Focus and Billit

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693058106769)

 

At Teamleader Focus, we are a big fan of working more efficiently. Our partners like to help us with that. That’s why Billit developed some integrations between Teamleader Focus and your favourite bookkeeping tools to make your life much easier. In this article we’ll talk about syncing your Teamleader Focus invoices to your bookkeeping tool.

The biggest advantage of using one of these integrations is that you don’t have to manually export your invoices from Teamleader Focus anymore to import them in your bookkeeping tool. This will happen automatically, saving you and your business time. Billit's payment check will immediately follow your invoices - marking them as paid in Teamleader Focus -, and all invoices will be available to your bookkeeper.
