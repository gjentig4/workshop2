4. Your uploaded file will automatically show in the meeting room. 

5. **All participants in the meeting room share your view of the uploaded files and documents**. So you're always on the same page.

6. Adding an additional file will minimize the opened file. **Minimized files show up on the right side of the meeting room.**
