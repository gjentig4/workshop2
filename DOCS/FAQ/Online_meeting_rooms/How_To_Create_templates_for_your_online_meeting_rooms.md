# How To: Create templates for your online meeting rooms

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694080087569)

When you have a lot of online meetings with customers, colleagues and other connections, you often upload the same documents. Therefore it's very useful to prepare a meeting room template that you can use for new meeting rooms. In this article, you can read how to create templates for your team. Only team admins will be able to create templates.

# 1. Create a meeting room template

To create a new meeting room template go to Meeting rooms -> Room templates or open [https://meeting.teamleader.eu/room-templates/](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/room-templates/) and click on **Create a new room template**.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694065282833)The meeting room template looks exactly like regular meeting rooms without the white label options. In the template you can:

- add whiteboards with annotations,

- upload files and images,

- prepare private notes,

- change the default meeting room settings and share settings.

You can't organise a meeting in the template window itself. That's why all the other options (eg. camera, share screen, recordings,..) are unusable and non-admins can't enter the room.

Changes in the templates will be automatically saved. To return to the templates overview you can click on the button 'Return to meeting template overview' at the right top of the room.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694077056529)

# 2. Edit, duplicate or delete a template

On the page of the room templates, you can find an overview of all the created templates. There are several options in the overview. You can:

- **Edit the template** by clicking on the name of the template.

- **Edit the name of the template** by clicking on the icon on the right side of the name. You will have to hover over the template row to see the icon.

By clicking on the three dots on the right end (next to the shown size) you can have a few additional options. You can:

- **Copy the template ID**. This option isn't usable in the Lead capture Booster at the moment though.

- **Duplicate the template** by clicking on Duplicate.

- **Delete the template** by clicking on Delete and confirming the deletion.

# 3. Create a template based on an existing meeting room

If you have a meeting room with some documents, private notes and settings that you would like to use for other sessions as well, you can save it as a template.

Follow these steps to save your room as a template:

- Open the meeting room settings

- Click on 'Save as template'

- Fill in a name for the template

- Click on 'Save as template'![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694077176081)

The new template will be visible in the overview of your [meeting room templates](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/room-templates/).

# 4. Create a new meeting room based on a template

There are 3 ways to create a meeting room with a template. You can create a meeting room in the dashboard, on the meeting rooms page or add a template to a meeting type of your booking page.

## 4.1 Create a meeting room on the dashboard or meeting rooms page

When you've created one or multiple templates you can now create a room on the [dashboard](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/dashboard/) or [meeting rooms page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/meeting-rooms/) and select the template it should be based on.

- Click on the button 'Create or join meeting room', a pop-up will open.

- 
Type the name of the meeting room that you would like to create, eg. John-Doe.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694065529489)

- Click on 'Create  from template..' and select a template, now you'll be forwarded to the room.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694097357073)

## 4.2 Add the template to a meeting type (scheduling)

If customers book a session with you which auto-generates an online meeting room, you will not be able to add templates in the same way as shown above. However, it is possible to add a meeting room template per meeting type. Every booked meeting of that meeting type will have the documents and settings of the template.

- Go to**[](https://www.vectera.com/scheduling/) Scheduling > Meeting types **and create or edit a meeting type.

- In the Meeting type details open the advanced settings.

- Select a meeting template from the dropdown

- Hit **Save the meeting type**
