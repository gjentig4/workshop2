**The image will show mirrored on your end**. Your guest(s) will see the image as you uploaded it! If you want to test this, you can enter the meeting room as a guest in incognito mode.

# Which file types can be used

Upload an image with one of the following formats: jpeg, jpg, png, ico, icon or tiff.

We recommend a size of at least 720px high and wide. Preferably a 4:3 ratio. (eg. 960 width and 720 height)

 

# Can guests use this background image

The image background is not available for guests. If your guest doesn't want his/her background to show, he/she can use [the blur background feature ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695092934673-How-To-Blur-the-background-of-your-camera)in settings!
