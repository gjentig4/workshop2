Desktop browsers

For an optimal experience, we recommend installing the latest version of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser) or [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

 

The Lead capture Booster supports the following browsers and versions. For screen sharing, co browsing and recording only the host is required to use the supported browsers.
 

- For participants, it's sufficient to join a meeting in a browser that supports Audio & Video sharing. They will be able to view all shared content.

- For co browsing, "viewing only" means you can not cobrowse a tab from your browser. You can browse on a tab that another participant is cobrowsing.

## 

All other mobile Operating Systems

It's possible to participate in an audio+video meeting and to watch uploaded whiteboards and shared screens. As mobile is view-only, you're not able to upload whiteboards and share screens.

If you have a tablet that works on Android you will have the same functionalities as Android smartphones but can also view recordings that have been made and uploaded in the cloud.

## Microsoft Surface

The only tablet that has the same functionality as a desktop is Microsoft Surface. Microsoft Surface has the same operating system as desktop computers that use Windows so everything will work as on desktop. You can install the Customer Meetings extension to use co-browsing and recording.
