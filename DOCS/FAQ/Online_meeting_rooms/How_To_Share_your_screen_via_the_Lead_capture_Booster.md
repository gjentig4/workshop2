## Safari

 

### Safari 15.5 or older

Share screen is only possible if you have Safari 13 or higher, and until version 15.5 you're only allowed to share your entire screen. This is due to technical reasons limited by Apple.

- 
In your meeting room click on **Share ****screen **

- 
A pop up will open where you can choose to Allow, Don't allow or never give permission to share your screen.

- 
Click on **Allow **and your screen will be shared![The Teamleader Focus video meeting interface with collaboration tools and call controls.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694217440657)

### Safari 16

In Safari 16 Apple introduced new ways to share your screen. You can choose to share a window or share a full screen.

 

This is how you can share your screen:

- 
In your meeting room click on **Share ****screen **

- 
A pop up will open where you can choose Allow to share window, Allow to share screen, or Don't allow.![Safari browser permission dialog asking to allow cloud.teamleader.eu to share the screen.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694239697937)

- 
Click on one of the Allow options and your screen will be shared

 

**Allow to share window**

If you select 'Allow to share window' it will only share one specific window, so not your entire screen. This can be your Safari browser, another browser or any program that is opened on your computer.

 

To stop sharing a window, you have 2 options:

 

1. Stop sharing from the window itself by clicking on the purple icon in the top left of the window. Then select Stop Sharing Window.![Browser screen sharing and window management menu in macOS](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694195105041)

 

2. Stop sharing from the meeting room by clicking on the red X in the top right corner of the shared screen.![Toolbar for screen sharing or document preview with zoom and close controls](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694224798353)

**Allow to share screen**

You can also share a full screen, in that case everything on the screen will be visible for other meeting participants.
