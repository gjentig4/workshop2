# How To: Activate noise reduction for your microphone

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695327557905)

 

If you have a lot of online meetings you or your participants might encounter background noise from somebody's microphone. To counter this we have a noise reduction feature which will improve your meetings.

# Activate noise reduction

You can activate the noise reduction from 2 locations: from the meeting room greet screen and in the meeting room settings. The setting will show the same activation status in both locations. 

 

## From the meeting room greet screen

- Open the meeting room so you will arrive on the greet screen.

- Click on '**Audio + Video**' or '**Audio only**' and allow microphone access to your browser if requested.

- Click on '**Change and test Cam / Mic**'

- In the Microphone settings you will see '**(BETA) Enable noise suppression**'. 

- Click on the toggle to enable noise reduction. If the toggle is coloured, it means that it's active.

- Join the meeting room.

# Remarks

- When you enable the noise reduction feature it will work for your own microphone. **Every user needs to activate noise reduction themselves** to block background noise from their microphone.

- When a user enables the noise reduction feature it will **shortly deactivate their microphone**. This will only take a maximum of 3 seconds before the audio comes through again.
