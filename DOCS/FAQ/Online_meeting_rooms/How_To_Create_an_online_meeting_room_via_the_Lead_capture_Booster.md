If you select a room, you can click on **Preview ****room** to preview the meeting room your customer will see.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695041543057)

- Note that if you select an online meeting room, the ‘Location’ of your meeting will be ‘Virtual meeting’ by default. If you do want to add a physical location, please remove the online meeting room first.

- Click on **Save**.

 

When the meeting is created, you’ll see the link to your meeting room in the meeting info, and you’ll be able to preview it there again as well.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695044572305)You can find and customise the meeting rooms you created in the Lead capture Booster via **Meeting rooms** > **Overview**.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695044648593)

After you’ve activated the Lead capture Booster an online meeting room called ‘*test-meeting-room*’ is created by default and synced to the Lead capture Booster. Keep in mind that this is a personal meeting room, so this test-meeting-room is linked to your user. Note that for every active user of your account, a personal meeting room will be created in the same format as ‘test-meeting-room-x’.

 

As an [admin ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)of your Teamleader Focus account you’ll have access to all meeting rooms of your colleagues via the ‘Team’ or ‘All’ tabs:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695057373073)You can change the **access ****rights** in the team settings or the meeting room invitation settings, so other colleagues could have access to the meeting rooms of others. 

Learn everything there is to know about the meeting rooms page [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694064596369-How-To-The-meeting-rooms-page-overview).

 

*Notes: *

- All your personal meeting rooms will be available to choose from whenever you create a new online meeting in your Teamleader Focus account. Keep in mind that it’s not possible to automatically select the same meeting room when you’re meeting with the same customer for example, you’ll need to select the room manually.

- When adding an online meeting in Teamleader Focus, [the meeting room templates](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694091190289-How-To-Create-templates-for-your-online-meeting-rooms) from the Lead capture Booster are not available to choose from. If you want a meeting room based on a template you need to create a personal meeting room in the Lead capture Booster first and then select that specific meeting room when you’re creating the meeting.

- When you’ve synced your Teamleader Focus calendar with [Google Calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690925270033-How-To-Integrate-Google-Calendar-with-Teamleader-Focus), [iCloud calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690933196689-How-To-Integrate-iCloud-with-Teamleader-Focus) or [Outlook Calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690974588305-How-To-Integrate-Microsoft-Exchange-or-Office-365-with-Teamleader-Focus) the online meeting room link will be transferred to that external calendar as well. 

 

## Invite contacts to the meeting

After you’ve created the meeting and - when you’ve created a new meeting room - the meeting room was synced to the Lead capture Booster, it’s time to start adding colleagues and contacts. 

 

***Note**: If you're on the Basic package of the Lead capture Booster, you'll only be able to have 1-on-1 meetings, so with a maximum amount of 2 people in a meeting room. If you use the Beyond package of the Lead capture Booster however, there is a maximum amount of **10 people** in a meeting room, including the host. Read more about the Basic vs Beyond features [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695070912017-The-Lead-capture-Booster-Basic-vs-Beyond-features).*

 

You can invite contacts to the meeting and send them a link to the online meeting by following these steps: 

- Click on the **+** next to ‘Contacts attending’ and add a contact.

- Enable the slider **Send meeting invitation**
**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695035467025)**

- Fill out the details or choose a template

- Make sure to include the variable #CUSTOMER_MEETING_ROOM_LINK in your invitation, so your online meeting room link is added to the email.
