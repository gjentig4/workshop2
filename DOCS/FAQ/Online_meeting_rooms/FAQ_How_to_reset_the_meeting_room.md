# 1. Clear meeting room content

It's possible to clear meeting room content during or after the meeting. This includes whiteboards, files and chat messages. This doesn't include Private notes, Recordings and Invite settings. To remove those you will have to [Reset the meeting room](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694849935377-FAQ-How-to-reset-the-meeting-room#2.-Reset-the-meeting-room).

 

## 1.1 Via the banner

If one of the participants uploads or edits a whiteboard or file or sends a chat message, then a banner will appear at the top of the meeting room on **the host's screen. **This banner will allow to clear the meeting room content (whiteboards, files and chat messages).

 

**![Information banner about saving meeting room content like whiteboards and chat history.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694873923857)**

The meeting host has 3 options:

- Ignore the banner and leave it where it is.

- Click on '**Click here**' to remove the whiteboards, files and chat messages.

- Click on '**Don't show this again**' to remove the banner and never show it again.

 

There are a few cases where** the banner won't show**:

- There are multiple hosts in the meeting room that are logged into their account.

- Share screen or cobrowse is activated.

- No new whiteboards, files or chat messages have been added.

- You have clicked on 'Don't show this again' at a previous moment.

- You're working in a template instead of a meeting room.

 

## 1.2 At the end of the meeting

When you select 'Leave' or 'End call for everyone' a pop-up will appear asking if you wish to keep the meeting room content or to clear it.

The host has 3 options:

- Close the pop-up by clicking on **X**. The host will stay in the meeting room and the content will remain the same.

- Click on '**Keep the data**'. The host will leave the room but all the whiteboards, files and chat history will remain in the meeting room.

- Click on '**Clear**'. This will remove all the whiteboards, files and chat history.

 

If you choose Keep the data or clear and you select '**Don't show this again**', then the meeting room will do as requested and won't show the pop-up again after future meetings. Selecting 'Don't show this again' in combination with click on the X to close the pop-up won't work. The pop-up will keep showing in this case.
