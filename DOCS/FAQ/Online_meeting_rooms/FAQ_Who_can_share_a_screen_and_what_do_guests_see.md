![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

Now that you know [how to share a screen](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694258382353-How-To-Share-your-screen-via-the-Lead-capture-Booster), you might have some extra questions. Can all guests share their screen? Do guests need to install the Google extension? What's the infinity mirror effect? In this article we explain who can use share screen and what it looks like for other participants.

 

# Who can use screenshare?

All participants can share a screen if they use Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge or Brave as the browser. 

It's not possible to share a screen if:

- 
You are using a mobile or an Ipad. Both are view-only.

- 
If [Presenter mode](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694139543313-FAQ-How-does-Presenter-Mode-work) is active, guests won't be able to share a screen

- 
Mac: if you don't [allow screen recording](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695162317841-FAQ-What-if-Share-screen-doesn-t-work-on-Mac) for your browser(s) in the privacy settings

*Note: Safari only allows you to share the full screen that you're working on!*

 

# Do guests need to install the extension in Chrome to use screenshare?

There's no need to install the extension in Chrome to share a screen. There's a visual difference on how the window/tab can be selected but essentially everyone can share a screen.

# What's the infinity mirror effect?

The "infinity mirror effect" occurs when you share the screen where you have opened the meeting room. Read more about it in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25870102929041-FAQ-What-is-the-infinity-mirror-effect-and-how-to-counter-it).

 

# What do guests see?

You can share your screen in 3 ways:

- 
Full screen

- 
App window

- 
Browser tab

 

## Full screen

If you choose to share a full screen, **the guest(s) will be able to follow everything on your screen**. If you share a full screen, the infinity mirror effect will show. Once you change to another tab or application the infinity mirror will be gone. Make sure to watch the example in [this help article!](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25870102929041-FAQ-What-is-the-infinity-mirror-effect-and-how-to-counter-it)

 

*Tip: Minimize the screen when sharing full screen. Don't forget to maximize it again when you want to share certain apps/pages. *

 

## App window

App window is perfect if you want to share one specific app but don't want to share the full screen. The guest will be able to follow all the steps in that application. Some good examples:

- 
Choose App window and select the browser if you want to switch easily between tabs in that browser.

- 
Choose App window to show and discuss things from one application.

If you share the browser where your meeting room is active and click on the meeting room tab, the infinity mirror will show.

*Tip: Minimize the screen when sharing the meeting room in app window. Don't forget to maximize it again when you want to share other tabs. *

 

## Browser tab

Sharing a browser tab means that you share one specific tab in your browser. If you open another tab, the guest will not be able to see this!

 

While sharing a browser tab, it's also possible to share audio. This is not possible in the other 2 options. Read more in [this link](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695117871633-How-To-Share-audio-while-sharing-your-screen) on how to share audio.

*Tip: Want to work together in one tab with your guest? Use cobrowse instead! In [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694263341969-How-To-Set-up-cobrowsing-with-the-Lead-capture-Booster) you can read how cobrowse works.*
