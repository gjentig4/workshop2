The collaboration features, booking pages and waiting rooms make it easy for teams to have advanced customer meetings with an easy setup. For team managers it's often useful to get an idea of how meetings are going and that's why we launched the meeting rooms live overview.

 

On the [meeting rooms overview page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/meeting-rooms/) team admins can easily get an overview of the personal and team waiting and meeting rooms. For both options they can have a live view of who's knocking and which meeting rooms are active.

## 1. Waiting rooms

Waiting rooms make it possible for guests to knock in a general room without having to book a meeting in advance. The knocking guest will be visible in the dashboard/meeting rooms overview and can be forwarded to a new or existing meeting room or can be denied access. There are personal and team waiting rooms.

## 2. Meeting rooms overview

Meeting activity can be monitored by the team on[ the meeting rooms overview page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/meeting-rooms/). Depending on the team settings, you can only see your own meeting rooms, or all the meeting rooms in your team.

 

On the meeting rooms overview page, you can use the meeting room filter, the search bar and change the view type.

 

### 2.1 Meeting room filter

The meeting room filter splits the meeting rooms in different categories based on the meeting room owner and the access rights. You can change the access rights in the [team settings](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/team/settings/) or the meeting room invite settings.

If a user or team has more than 24 meeting rooms, pagination will apply.

 

Most users will have 3 filter options: Personal, Team and All.![A segmented toggle switch with options for Personal, Team, and All views.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694049730321)

- 
Personal: These are all the meeting rooms where you are the owner of the meeting room.

- 
Team: All the team meeting rooms where you have ‘Is host’ or ‘Can always join’ rights. This item is not visible if you are the only team member in your team.

- 
All: All the personal and team meeting rooms + all the meeting rooms from other teams where you have been invited with ‘Is host’ or ‘Can always join’ rights.

#### **Hiding the team tab: solo teams**

The **Team** tab is not visible if you are the only team member in your team. 

 

If you have restrictive [team access levels](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694719583633-How-To-Team-settings-in-the-Lead-capture-Booster) (i.e. default team access level = should knock, allow override = false), the **Team** tab will still be visible, but won’t show any more meeting rooms than the **Personal** tab.

 

### 2.2 Search bar

If you’re looking for a specific meeting room, you can use the search bar to limit results. Type the name of the meeting room you’re looking for and hit enter.

### 2.3 Card view or list view

Meeting rooms will be shown in card view or list view:

 

#### 2.3.1 Card view

Card view shows the meeting rooms in separate cards containing the following information:

- 
Meeting room name

- 
‘Copy public link’ and ‘Delete’ buttons (hover over card to show)

- 
Active or opened status

- 
Current hosts/customers in the meeting room

- 
Active whiteboard + name of the whiteboard![Meeting room card in Teamleader Focus showing status, participants, and management icons.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694074350481)

#### 2.3.2 List view

List view shows the meeting rooms below each other containing the following information:

- 
Meeting room name

- 
Full name of the meeting room owner

- 
Last activity

- 
Size of the meeting room

- 
Three dots, consisting of 'Copy link’ and ‘Delete meeting room’ options

#### 2.3.3 Order of the meeting rooms

Meeting rooms will show in the following order:

- 
Active meeting rooms* - most recent shows first

- 
Opened meeting rooms** - most recent shows first

- 
Date of last activity = either last opened or last created![The Meeting Rooms overview page in Teamleader Focus showing personal meeting room cards.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694060496785)

 

In the above example **test**-**meeting-room-1 **is an active meeting room, **test-meeting-room** is an opened meeting room and the other meeting rooms are not active nor opened. Those meeting rooms are ordered based on last created or last opened.

 

E.g**. test-meeting-room-2 **is created more recently than the other one so this meeting room shows before the other one although it hasn’t been used yet.

 

**Active meeting room: 2 or more participants with at least one active stream.*

***Opened meeting room: 1 or more participants but no active streams.*

 

## 3. Live overview

By default, a snapshot of the meeting room is taken every 5 minutes. The active whiteboard shows when refreshing the page or selecting a different page filter.

 

### 3.1. Live meeting rooms overview

When a meeting room is opened, a snapshot is taken every 5 minutes. When you visit the meeting rooms overview page, the meeting rooms will not auto-refresh, you must reload the page to see any updates.

 

Every 5 minutes, a snapshot will be taken of opened **Whiteboards**. If a whiteboard is minimised, the last snapshot of the whiteboard will remain visible in the meeting rooms overview page.

 

**Shared** **screens** **will not be shown as a preview**! Instead, the last active whiteboard will be shown.

 

### 3.2 No snapshot

There are certain situations where a snapshot doesn’t show/update after 15 sec:

- 
The meeting room tab is not the active tab. When the host is visiting a different tab than the meeting room tab, a snapshot can’t be taken of the meeting room due to a browser limitation.

- 
On the moment of the snapshot the user is still drawing or typing something. The drawings won’t be visible until the next snapshot.

## 4. Persistent meeting rooms

Typically, when you end a meeting, all communication is gone. The Lead capture Booster works differently: the chat history, the notes on the whiteboards, the meeting minutes, all uploaded files and recordings: **everything is stored** so you can easily share that with others or you can revert back to those after the meeting/pick up the conversation much faster next time you meet.

 

So everything I upload or do will be saved forever in the meeting room?

No, it's possible to manually delete whiteboards or recordings and even to [reset the meeting room](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694849935377-FAQ-How-to-reset-the-meeting-room). If you think a meeting room will be of no further use for you, it's also possible to delete the room.
