Video chatting is awesome for connecting with customers, colleagues, friends and friendly strangers, but without some method of recording them, it's easy to forget what was discussed.

Fortunately, the Lead capture Booster makes it simple to record and share your video meetings with anyone who missed or whoever wants a refresher. Here's how it works:
