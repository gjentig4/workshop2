Scoured the support centre but still have burning questions? Don’t worry, we won’t leave you hanging! Read this article to learn how to contact our support team and keep track of your question via the Teamleader Focus support portal.

 

## Log in to the support portal

First of all, you need to log in once to the support portal:

- 
Click on the **Login **button in the top right-hand corner of the support centre

- 
Fill out your Teamleader Focus credentials; they’ll be remembered next time you visit the support centre

 

## Log a ticket

Have a question you can’t find the answer to in our support centre? Follow these steps:

- 
Navigate to the button **Contact ****us **at the bottom of the support centre and click on it.![Teamleader Focus support footer with links to help resources and a 'Contact us' button.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693671870865)

- 
Fill out the form

Filling out a subject will show you some **Related ****articles **that might provide a solution to your problem already

- 
“**How does this impact your busines****s**" asks you about the severity of the problem

- 
Insert a **description**. In case of a problem in Teamleader Focus, handy for us to know are the following:

Where exactly in Teamleader Focus are you experiencing problems (Calendar, Companies, Contacts, Deals,...)?

- 
Do you receive an error message?

- 
Are you the only user in the account experiencing the problem?

- 
Which browser are you using (Firefox, Chrome, Safari,...)?

- 
Since when do you experience the problem?

- 
What have you already tried to try and solve the problem?

- 
Which actions were you taking when the problem occurred?

- 
Add an attachment via **Attach ****a ****file **if needed. The more information we have, the faster we are able to help you!

- 
**Submit **the ticket

- 
One of our product experts of the Teamleader Focus support team will personally reach out to you and answer the ticket within 24 hours. 

 

## Keep track of your ticket

After you’ve submitted your ticket, you can easily keep track of the status of your ticket via the support portal. Click on your name > **Requests **in the header of the support centre. Here you find your tickets.

Each customer question we receive is called a ticket. Whenever a new question is filed, it gets a unique number and this is your ticket number.

 

Clicking on the ticket shows you an overview of the conversation. Instead of from your mailbox, you can even answer the ticket from within the support centre itself!

 

### Contact us in-app

Instead of contacting us from the support centre, it’s also possible to **contact us in-app in Teamleader Focus** as well!

Just navigate to the **question ****mark **in the top right-hand corner of your account.
