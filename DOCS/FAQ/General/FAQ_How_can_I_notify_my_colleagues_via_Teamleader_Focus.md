![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

You can notify your colleagues in Teamleader Focus by using the** @ symbol** in the 'Activities' in Companies, Contacts, Tasks, Meetings, Projects, Invoices and Products*:

**Note that notifying your colleagues is not possible in an internal note in a ticket, [but you can add a task to your ticket and assign it your colleague.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691929164049-FAQ-How-do-I-link-a-task-to-a-ticket)*

When notifying your colleague(s) in a task, you'll also have the possibility to add an attachment.

 

Furthermore, you can also use the @ symbol in the history of the deal and add a note.

The person that is mentioned in the note will now receive a notification via the bell and an email. 

If you don't want to receive notifications emails, go to your **user icon** in the top right-hand corner > **my profile** > **notifications** to deactivate it.
