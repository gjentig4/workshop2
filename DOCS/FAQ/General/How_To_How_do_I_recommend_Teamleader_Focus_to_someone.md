How does it work?

You don’t really have to put in much effort to start gaining from it. You can do it in 2 easy steps:

- In your Teamleader Focus account, click on your user icon on the top right hand corner and go to ‘Want to earn €300? Refer us!’.

- On this page, you’ll find your personalized referral link, which you can send to other people. You can directly send them an email by clicking on ‘Send Mail’ or you can click on ‘Copy Link’ and send them the link manually:

Once your contact clicks on the link, he/she will be lead to a separate web page that offers more information about Teamleader Focus. On that page he or she can activate a free 14-day trial. If your contact does so, you will be notified on your referral page and via email.

 

From then on, we’ll do the work. If he/she decides to become an actual Teamleader Focus customer, you’ll be notified again and you’ll receive your gift card. Hooray!

 

Note that you can always keep track of how many referrals you’ve made in the past on the referral page. You’ll see how many rewards you’ve earned and how many are still pending.
