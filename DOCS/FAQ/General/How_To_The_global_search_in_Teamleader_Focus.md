# How To: The global search in Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697671000849)

 

No matter where you are in Teamleader Focus, you can find a magnifying glass icon in the top right-hand corner of your account. This icon refers to the global search function in Teamleader Focus. Read all about what it is and which fields you can search on here!

## What

The global search functionality basically provides a general search over all modules in Teamleader Focus making it more suitable for generic searches as compared to module search which is meant for targeted searches per module. The global search function is especially handy when you quickly want to find something or someone across your Teamleader Focus account.

- 
When searching, the **exact search ****term ****matches **are **highlighted**:

- 
**Additional data **is provided **around the search results **to distinguish unique results and give more context. The **creation ****date **of the item is always shown on the right. 
Examples of additional data provided per module are:

For contacts/companies:

Phone number

- Address

- 
For deals: 

Linked customer

- Deal amount

- Deal status

- 
For invoices:

Linked customer

- Amount (excl. VAT)

[**Fuzzy search**](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fuzzy-search#:~:text=A%20fuzzy%20search%20is%20a,correspond%20to%20the%20desired%20information.&text=A%20fuzzy%20matching%20program%20can,checker%20and%20spelling%2Derror%20corrector.) is supported, we are **lenient towards typo****s** and suggest the most relevant results related to your search

- 
We **allow **for an **incomplete ****search**, meaning you don't need to type the complete search term and the search will start already

- **Accents **are supported

- The **maximum number of search results is 50**, so try to be more specific in case of too many results

 

## Sorting & filtering

The search results are **grouped **in **categories **e.g. 'Companies', 'Deals, 'Invoices', and a number will be shown next to it.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697654611345)The number displays the amount of times a search term occurs in a module, ranked from left to right (high to low number of occurrences).
If there are no results in a certain module then that tab won't be shown. Depending on your [user settings](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691605666193-FAQ-Why-do-I-not-have-the-same-features-in-my-Teamleader-Focus-account-as-my-colleague) and which modules you do or don't have access too, some results might be hidden as well.

 

As for the **sorting **it will be on 'most relevant' by default, meaning the most relevant items will be ranked highest:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697654659345)You can however also choose to sort on:

- Newest

- Oldest

- Alphabetical (a-z)

- Alphabetical (z-a)

 

### Tips

- When searching, try to limit the number of characters and avoid spaces between words as they can have an influence on the relevancy of the results.

- Apart from the global search, you can always use the module search function for an in-depth and targeted search.
