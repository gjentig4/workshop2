*At Teamleader Focus, we're committed to ensuring the security of your data. While we've implemented robust security measures on our end, we believe that your active participation is vital in enhancing the overall safety of your Teamleader Focus account. Here are some practical guidelines to help you take charge of your online security.*

 

## 1. Set a strong password

 

Your password is a key defence. Ensure it's unique and robust. While we've set the stage for security, your choice of a strong, **unique password** is a fundamental step in keeping your account safe. If you have any reason to believe that your password might be compromised, [reset it and choose to log out of all current browser sessions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691103419281-FAQ-How-do-I-reset-my-password#:~:text=setup%20via%20email.-,Change%20password,-Only%20looking%20to).

 

## 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

 

Take advantage of [our Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) feature](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692015506577-How-To-Set-up-MFA-security). It adds an extra layer of security to your account, further strengthening the protective measures already in place.

You can also [enforce MFA](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695959602833-How-To-Enforce-Multi-Factor-Authentication-MFA) for the users in your account to make sure everyone is following the same security guidelines.

 

## 3. Automatically log out after a period of inactivity

 

Use our **Login timeout feature** to your advantage. [Set a period for automatic logout ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692088895505-FAQ-Can-I-set-an-automatic-timeout-logout)after inactivity to reduce the risk of unauthorised access if you step away from your device.

 

## 4. Simplify with Single Sign-On (SSO)

 

Simplify your login process and enhance security [by activating Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693981217041-How-To-Log-in-to-Teamleader-Focus-via-Single-sign-on). This feature seamlessly integrates with our existing security measures, making your experience both convenient and secure.

 

## 5. Admin Rights Management

 

Take control of admin rights. **Only grant them to users who truly need them**. This practical step minimises the risk of data manipulation and aligns with our efforts to maintain a secure environment. [Read this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) to get an overview of all rights available to admin users.

 

## 6. Account Life cycle Management

 

**Deactivate users who no longer need access to the account**. This ensures that only active team members can access sensitive information, maintaining a secure digital workspace. If necessary, [you can still reactivate deactivated users later](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690718823953-How-To-Deactivating-a-user-in-Teamleader-Focus), or [transfer their records to another user](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693018842513-How-To-Replacing-one-user-by-another). 

 

## 7. Stay Alert to Phishing Threats

 

Verify the authenticity of received emails, especially those containing links and urging you to take quick action. The best way to determine if an email really comes from Teamleader Focus is by checking the sender's email address carefully.

 

Teamleader Focus only uses the following domains:

*(focus).teamleader.eu*

*(focus).teamleader.be*

*(focus).teamleader.nl*

*(focus).teamleader.fr*

*(focus).teamleader.de*

*(focus).teamleader.it*

*meeting.teamleader.eu*

*online.teamleader.eu*

*marketplace.teamleader.eu*

*auth.focus.teamleader.eu*

 

### Some tips on how to spot phishing emails: 

- 
**Examine the sender's email address closely:** be cautious of misspellings or unusual variations in the domain.

- Hover your mouse over any **links** in the email without clicking: verify that the URL displayed matches the official website. Again, be wary of URLs with tiny misspellings or extra characters.

- Watch for **urgency and threats**: phishing emails often create a sense of urgency or threat to prompt quick action.

- Be cautious with unexpected **attachments** or requests for **sensitive information**.

- Check the **email ****signature**: if an email lacks contact information or an official signature, it may be suspicious.

 

### Example of an authentic email

The ‘from’ address clearly corresponds to our teamleader.eu domain:

### Example of a phishing email

The domain is misspelled (‘teamsleader’ instead of ‘teamleader’), as well as the URL it’s referring to. Also notice the sense of urgency requiring you to click the URL within the first 24 hours:

If you are ever in doubt, feel free to [forward the email to our Support team](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065) so they can validate the authenticity for you.
