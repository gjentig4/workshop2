Companies or individuals who wish to sell Teamleader Focus can engage in a **long-term collaborative partnership** through the Partner Program. If you simply want to **recommend Teamleader Focus to friends or family**, you can use Teamleader Focus' Referral Program.

 

## Referrals

Teamleader Focus' Referral Program allows you, as a customer, to refer friends or family and earn a reward.
