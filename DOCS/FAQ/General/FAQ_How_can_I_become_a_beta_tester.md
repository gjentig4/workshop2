# FAQ: How can I become a beta tester?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693586233745)

Ever since we started Teamleader Focus, beta testing has been a vital part of our development process. Having users test features before their official launch has been of indisputable value in the evolution of our product. Want to become a beta tester? Keep on reading!

 

## Why?

Every new Teamleader Focus feature or improvement we launch is built** based upon user and data research**. Long story short: we create it based on **how you use Teamleader Focus**. A Teamleader Focus beta user is someone who’s the first one to play around with a new feature and spills their guts about their experience. Next, our Product and Development team uses that incredibly precious feedback to make improvements, dot the i’s and cross the t’s, before all our users get to benefit from it.

 

Our **one-size-fits-all product philosophy **is a key component of our beta testing strategy: we strive to offer the best customer experience, for all types of users. That means we want to organise beta tests for a diverse group of users to see how strong new features are in real life. Because who can give us more valuable feedback about our software than the people who use it - day in day out - to improve their business?

 

## What?

Beta testers get to:

- 
**Report bugs **or cracks in our software

- 
**Offer suggestions** on how we can improve these beta features

- 
**Test features** without any prior knowledge **to identify potential obstacles**

- 
**Complete surveys and polls** about these beta features about, for example, the intuitiveness and user-friendliness of features or obstacles so we can adapt our features and documentation accordingly

You'll be able to directly give your feedback to our development team by clicking on the **beta feedback **button which you can find in the bottom right-hand corner in your Teamleader Focus account:
