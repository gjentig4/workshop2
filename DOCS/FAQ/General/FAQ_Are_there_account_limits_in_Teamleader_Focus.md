![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

In Teamleader Focus, the number of contacts, companies, and so on, you can add to your account is limited.

 

An overview of the different limits in our platform: 

- 
In your CRM, as default you can [add no more than 10,000 contacts](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691553397137-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-contact-in-Teamleader-Focus) and [companies](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691985605777-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-company-in-Teamleader-Focus) combined. For example, if you add 2,000 contacts, you can add no more than 8,000 additional contacts or companies. You can increase this standard amount by paying a supplement of €11/month per 10,000 contacts and companies combined. Note that the hard limit for contacts and companies combined is 200,000.

- In your Products, by default you can [add no more than 10,000 products](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692618041233-How-To-Importing-products-into-Teamleader-Focus). You can increase this standard amount by paying a supplement of €11/month per 10,000 products. Note that the hard limit for products is 150,000.

- 
Since Teamleader Focus is an online tool, as default you have 35 GB as storage that you can use to upload and keep files. If needed, you can also increase this storage by paying an additional amount of €3/month per 10 GB extra. Note that the hard limit is 195 GB.**If you need extra clients, products or storage,[ please send a ticket to our support team.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/en/support/tickets/new)**

***Note: ***If you also have the [Lead capture Booster in your account](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster), then there's a limit of 10 GB cloud storage per user of the Lead capture Booster. This is accumulated per account. So, if you have 3 users with access to the Booster, you have 30GB storage in the Lead capture Booster, but 1 user can use e.g. 20 GB, if the other two only use 10 GB combined.

- 
In Teamleader Focus, the hard limit for [custom fields ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus)you can add in contacts, companies, deals, and projects is 50. For all the other sections in Teamleader Focus, the standard limit of 25 applies. It’s important to double-check whether fields are actually useful or whether you’re repeating fields throughout your account. 

- 
In general, our platform ideally fits 2 to 50 users. You have the ability to add up to 100 users but bear in mind that Teamleader Focus isn’t designed for this use case on a technical level.
