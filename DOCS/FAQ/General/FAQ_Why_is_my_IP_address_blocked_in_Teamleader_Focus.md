# FAQ: Why is my IP address blocked in Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

Do you want to access your **Teamleader ****Focus ****account** but you receive a message that your IP address has been blocked due to suspicious activity? Take a look at this article to find out the possible reasons for the alert.

 

## Why do we block IP addresses?

Every night, Teamleader Focus synchronizes with a blacklist of IP addresses. That blacklist contains numerous IP addresses that are blocked because they were used by spammers, bots, hackers etc. and are linked with suspicious activities.

Usually, the IP block occurred because of one of the following reasons:

- 
You logged in from a **public network **like the ones in a bar, a train or an airport. Other people used this public IP address for suspicious activities, causing it to be blocked.

- 
Your computer is infected with a **virus** and is, for example, sending out spam.

- 
Someone on your network has a virus or is related to **suspicious activities**.

- 
You applied **wrong API credentials** for more than 10 times in 10 minutes.

 

## How to get on the whitelist again?

**For safety reasons, we need to take these blocks very seriously and cannot take any risks.**

- Are you not in the office or connected to the wifi network that you normally use? See the table below.

- Check for your IP address. It will be stated in the error message you receive.

- 
[Contact our support](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065) so we can check for the underlying reason and, depending on the latter, possibly unblock the IP address.

 

**Reason**
**Consequence**

You logged in from a **public network in a bar, hotel, airport...**

You should connect to a safe network, when public networks are abused there is not much we can do. **On your regular network in the office, you will be able to log in again**. We cannot whitelist the bad ip address.

Your computer is infected with a **virus or s**omeone who uses the same wifi network has a virus/is related to **suspicious activities**.

**Get rid of the virus and contact your IT support. If the problem persists, contact your IP-provider to solve the issue and be marked as safe again**, then you will automatically disappear from the blacklists we sync with. We cannot whitelist you as long as you still appear on other blacklists.

You used **wrong API credentials more than 10 times in 10 minutes**.

**We can whitelist your IP address**. Please get this fixed in your code.
