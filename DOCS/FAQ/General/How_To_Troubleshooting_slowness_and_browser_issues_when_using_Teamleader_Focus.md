# How To: Troubleshooting slowness and browser issues when using Teamleader Focus

![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/36486948631825) 

Technical issues can be frustrating, especially when they affect your daily work. To help resolve any loading problems or slowness you might experience while using Teamleader Focus, we have compiled some practical troubleshooting steps and questions. By following these guidelines, you’ll help us identify and solve the issue more efficiently.

 

# Loading issues 

If you experience issues with loading certain modules in Teamleader Focus, you could check the following things:

- Try using an **incognito **browser window.
E.g. in Chrome: click on the three dots in the top-right corner > New incognito window.
If you don't have any issues in incognito mode, the issue might be related to cookies and cache. In that case, please clear your cookies and cache via your browser settings.

- Check if your **device **and **browser **are fully **updated**, and update them if necessary.
E.g. in Chrome: click on the three dots in the top-right corner > Help > About Google Chrome.
You’ll see if a new update is available. If no update is found, consider updating your device's operating system and then rechecking for any Chrome updates.

- If this still doesn’t resolve the issue, you can also review your **browser extensions **in Chrome (puzzle piece icon in the same bar as the three dots). Try disabling your extensions one by one to see if one of them is causing the problem.

 

# Slowness

If you experience general slowness you can check the following things:

- Does the issue occur for every user? If so, are all users connected to the same network?

- Could you perform a speed test and share the results with us?

- Which browser are you using? Does the issue also occur in a different browser?

- Could you try clearing your cookies and cache and see if the slowness persists when using an incognito window? Does it work better then?

- Are you using a VPN? If so, does disabling the VPN resolve the issue?

- Does the slowness affect all modules or only a specific one / after a particular action?

- Would you be able to record your session via [https://focus.teamleader.eu/app/debug/start-recording](https://focus.teamleader.eu/app/debug/start-recording) so we can see exactly what’s happening? When you click the link, the recording will start immediately — don’t forget to click Stop when you're done. Please let us know the date and time you recorded the session and when exactly in the session the problem occurs or in which module/during which steps.
 

With this information, we can rule out possible causes such as internet connection issues, VPN interference, browser-specific problems, and whether the issue is affecting all users or only specific ones. The recording will also help us attempt to reproduce the slowness in your or our own accounts. [You can contact us this way.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065)

 

# Unexpected options in dropdowns (browser autofill)

If you see dropdown options (e.g. products or custom field values) that don’t exist in Teamleader Focus, your **browser’s autofill** is likely causing it.
These suggestions can look slightly different from Teamleader Focus' layout (for example, with a light blue background) and might not fill in product details correctly when selected, such as prices on quotations.
 

## How to check

Open Teamleader Focus in an **incognito/private window**.
If the unwanted options disappear, they come from your browser and not from Teamleader Focus.
 

## How to fix

- Clear your **cache and cookies**.

- **Disable autofill** in your browser.
 

### Chrome

- Go to **Settings > Autofill and passwords > Addresses and more**.

- Turn off **Save and fill addresses**.

- To remove a single suggestion, highlight it and press **Shift + Delete** (Windows) or **Fn + Shift + Delete** (Mac).
 

### Safari

- Go to **Safari > Settings > Autofill**.

- Uncheck **Other forms** (and other options if desired).
