# FAQ: What browsers does Teamleader Focus support?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697873872657)

 

In this article, you’ll find an overview of the browsers Teamleader Focus supports. We strongly recommend using one of these browsers when accessing Teamleader Focus.

## Supported browsers

Our team of engineers designs Teamleader Focus to support the newest versions of these web browsers:

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/new/)

- 
[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

*Note**: We ended support for Internet Explorer in **September ****2020**. Read everything about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697901886609-End-of-support-for-Internet-Explorer-11).*

## Something not working?

- 
The browser may need updating. Check for updates in the Help section of your browser menu and activate automatic updates while you’re there. Without the most recent version, Teamleader Focus features may look weird or not work properly.

- 
Browser plugins or extensions like adblockers are interfering with something. Try opening Teamleader Focus in a private/incognito window without plugins or extensions to rule out they’re at fault. You can find the option in your browser menu. 

- 
Check [our status pag](https://status.teamleader.eu/)e for ongoing issues.

- 
Make sure you try to access Teamleader Focus via a secure private network and that it doesn’t restrict access to certain services. Contact your network responsible for more information.
