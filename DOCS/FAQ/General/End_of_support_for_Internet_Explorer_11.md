We will stop supporting Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) as a browser for Teamleader Focus from **01/09/2020**. If you are currently using IE 11, you’ll need to [switch to another browser](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697874143121-FAQ-What-browsers-does-Teamleader-Focus-support) in order to access your Teamleader Focus account. If you are required to use a Microsoft product, we recommend switching to [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

 

In this article, you’ll read more about why we made this decision, what this means for you as a Teamleader Focus user and what you’ll need to do.

## Why?

While Internet Explorer once was the most popular web browser, it hasn’t been for a while now. Here are the main reasons why we’re ending support for IE 11:

- 
Microsoft Edge replaced IE 11 as the default browser on Windows in 2015. Since then Internet Explorer has not received major updates, making it considerably more **vulnerable to security threats** compared to other browsers we support.

- 
IE 11 has a **big technical gap** with other browsers and supports far less modern-day web browser functionalities. This prevents us from building you the best Teamleader Focus experience possible.

- 
Avoiding and fixing issues for IE 11 is **very time-consuming** as they only occur in this specific browser. Building you the best Teamleader Focus experience possible goes terribly slow if you have to take IE 11 into account.

- 
Only [a small percentage (less than 3%) of web traffic](https://netmarketshare.com/?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222019-07%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222020-06%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D) uses Internet Explorer. We see an even **lower usage (less than 2%)** with Teamleader Focus users that decreases month over month.

By no longer supporting IE 11 we can ensure everyone operates in a safe and working Teamleader Focus environment while enabling our engineers to introduce the latest functionalities without a hassle.

## What will happen?

On **September 1, 2020, **Teamleader will no longer be accessible via IE 11. Since we’ll no longer fix issues for this browser or make new features compatible with it, we’ll introduce a **blocking ****screen**. You’ll need to switch to a different browser in order to access your Teamleader Focus account.

## What do I do?

We recommend switching to one of our supported browsers as soon as possible, so your transition can go smoothly. We recommend the following browsers:

- 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

- 
[Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

- 
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
