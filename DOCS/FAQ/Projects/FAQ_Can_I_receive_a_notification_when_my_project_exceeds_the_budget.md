![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089) 

*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089)  

Yes! Teamleader Focus is designed to notify you when your project is close to or has exceeded its budget. Staying informed about your budget allows you to manage expenses effectively, avoid overspending, and make adjustments in real-time. Here’s everything you need to know about how these notifications work.

 

# What triggers a notification?

Notifications are sent under the following circumstances:

- When your project exceeds the budget:

For Time and Materials projects: 
When the price of a project exceeds the budget

- 
For Non-Billable and Fixed Price projects: 
When the budget spent of a project exceeds the budget

- When your project reaches 95% of the budget:
For all projects, notifications alert you when the budget is nearing its limit.
 

# How will I receive these notifications?

Notifications are sent through:

- In-app notifications (notification bell in the top right-hand corner)

- Email notifications
 

# Who receives these notifications?

Only [project owners](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project) are notified about budget limits being exceeded or approached.
 

# Are there conditions where notifications won’t be sent?

Notifications won’t be sent in the following scenarios:

- If no budget has been set for the project

- If ‘time estimated’ on tasks isn’t filled out
