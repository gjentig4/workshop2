# How To: ProjectCloud in Teamleader Focus

![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28017650529169)

 

*ProjectCloud is currently in **BETA**, meaning we’re still working on this. In the upcoming months, more functionality will be added to this feature.*
 

Within a project, it’s possible to give your customer or an external party access to your project via ProjectCloud. They don't have any editing rights, but they can see the progress of your project. Read all about it here!

# 

What

ProjectCloud within a project is the ability to share live details of a project with a customer or a third party in the form of a shareable link (URL). This comes in handy when you want to give someone an update on the status of your project and/or the tasks/materials/meetings attached to it, without revealing more information on internal budget and/or costs.

 

A ProjectCloud link is specific to each project and is only accessible via the URL shared by you. Someone visiting ProjectCloud can view the following elements:

- Project title

- The logo and initials of your [company entity](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Start and end date of the project

- All project lines and their statuses

Groups

- Tasks

- Materials

- Meetings

How

Only [admin users](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin), users with [admin access to all projects or project owners](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project) are able to create a link for ProjectCloud. Follow these steps to create a shareable link to the ProjectCloud environment of your project:

- Go to your project

- Go to **Project info**

- Go to ProjectCloud and click on **+

**

- Fill out a **name** for the link

- Fill out an **expiry date** for the link. After this date the link becomes inaccessible. By default this is set a year after the end date of the project, but you can edit this date.

*Note*: It’s possible to create multiple ProjectCloud links for one project. Each link can have a different expiry date and can be shared with different parties.

# Customise ProjectCloud

As mentioned in the screen above, you can customise your ProjectCloud portal as well, e.g. matching the colours to your brand. [Read more about it here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690839495441-How-To-Personalising-Teamleader-Focus-cloud-platforms)

# Notes

As ProjectCloud is still in beta, more features will be added later. Think of:

- Showing more information on ProjectCloud (budget, custom fields,...)

- Hiding items on ProjectCloud

- Including invoices on ProjectCloud
