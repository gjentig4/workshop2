*This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089) 

Next to setting up the [external hourly price](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691956252177-How-To-Setting-different-types-of-hourly-rates) for a certain user you can also define the internal cost of your employees. Discover here what this is, how to set it and when to use it.

 

## What is it?

 

The internal cost represents how much costs (in salaries) are made for every hour tracked by the employee. Figuring out how much an employee costs on a monthly or yearly base isn’t all that hard. But how do you translate this into an hourly rate? You have to keep certain things in mind, such as bank holidays, leave, taxes & benefits…

There are a few calculations to help you determine this cost. But we suggest contacting your payroll provider for a detailed calculation. 

- Gross salary of the employee / available monthly hours

The full capacity of an employee is 173 hours in a schedule of 40 hours per week. That gives us for example:  €3000 per month / 173 hours = € 17,35/hour

- Holidays or overhead (taxes and benefits) not included

- Gross salary * overhead factor / available monthly hours minus holidays

Say you have 20 paid holidays, then the amount of available hours per month is calculated as: (40 hours * 52 weeks) - (20 paid vacation days * 8 hours per day) / 12 months = 160 hours. That makes our calculation: € 3000 / 160 = € 18,75/hour

- However you also have to keep your overhead into account. To get an exact calculation, it’s best to consult with your payroll management. For an estimation however, you can use an overhead factor: €3000 * 30% overhead / 160 hours = € 24,38/hour

- Overhead covers bonuses, taxes, insurances, etc. People could include non-billable employees in this overhead as well

 

## How do I set my internal cost in Teamleader Focus?

 

First of all: only [Teamleader Focus admins](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) with **access to Users and projects** are able to set an internal cost per employee. To set an internal cost for a user, follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings > Users**

- Click on **the name of the user** for which you want to add an internal cost

- Fill in the field ‘Internal cost’ by inserting an amount per hour

## When to use it?

The internal hourly cost comes in handy when you are using the project module and you want to see the margin on a project. The margin is the overview of the costs you’ve made in relation to the price of the project. This feature also tracks for example how much costs are spent by people tracking time on a project. Keep in mind that the internal cost for every assignee of the project needs to be set in **Settings **> **Users **(see above).

 

To view the margin on a project:

- Go to your project

- Click on the tab ‘Project info’

- Consult ‘Margin’:
