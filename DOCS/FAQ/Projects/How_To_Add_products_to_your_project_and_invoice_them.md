*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089)  

Including products in your project and invoicing them helps you keep track of what you're actually delivering to your clients and make sure you get paid for it. Read all about it here!

 

## Adding products

There are four ways of linking a product as a material to your project.

 

- Add a new material in your project:
![The 'Add task' dropdown menu in Teamleader Focus showing the 'Add material' option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695790035857)

Start typing to select a product from your product catalogue:
![Selecting a work type for a task in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695852627217)

- Go to the side panel of an existing material and click on **+Product** to select a product from your product list:

- When using products from your product catalogue on a quotation, and then converting that quotation to a project:
![Interface for converting a quotation to a project in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695852828433)
 

- When adding time tracking linked to a project, you have the option to add extra costs as materials/products to your project. [Read all about it here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/31353971388561-How-To-Add-extra-costs-or-mileage-on-a-project)

 

When adding products from your product list as materials to your project, the product description, unit, unit price and unit cost are taken over from what you defined in the product. These can of course still be edited if you’d like to change things. Also note that if filled out, you’ll also be able to view the remaining [stock ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691712397713-How-To-Stock-management-in-Teamleader-Focus)of your product within the project.

## Editing/deleting products

**Edit **a product of a project material by going to your project and opening the material. Click next to the name of the product and choose another one:

**Delete **a product from your material by deleting the material altogether or by opening the material and clicking next to the product and clicking on the little x.

## Invoicing products

When [invoicing your project,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus) you’ll see that the products you linked to a material will also be taken over on the invoice converted from the project:

When booking the invoice, the [stock ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691712397713-How-To-Stock-management-in-Teamleader-Focus)of your product will decrease.
