# How To: Add a project in Teamleader Focus

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

 

***This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089) 

The project module or Project Booster in Teamleader Focus allows you to create, organise and monitor your projects from start to finish. You can break down complex tasks into manageable components, set deadlines, assign responsibilities, and track progress—all in one place. Read all about it here.

 

## The project module

In the realm of productivity and efficient task management, having a comprehensive system to organise and track projects is essential. By adding a project, you establish a **dedicated space** where you can outline **project goals, define specific tasks, allocate resources accordingly or add materials.** This not only helps you gain a clear understanding of the project scope but also enables you to identify potential roadblocks or areas that require additional attention.

 

You can also stay up to date with **time ****management**. By setting deadlines for individual groups, tasks or materials within the project, you can effectively manage your time, prioritise activities, and ensure that important tasks are met in a timely manner.

 

## How To

You can create a project from scratch or you can create one based on a quotation. For the purpose of this article we’ll create one from scratch, but you can follow the flow described [in this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695713796625-How-To-Convert-a-deal-or-quotation-into-a-project) if you want to convert a quotation into a project.

- Go to **Projects **> **Add project > Add a project from scratch **or click on the **+ > Project > Add a project from scratch** in the top right-hand corner in your account 
*Note that you could also choose to **Add a project from a template**, *[*which you can read everything about here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/27877954273297-How-To-Project-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus)

If you have set up [required custom fields on project level,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691611839633-FAQ-Can-you-make-fields-required-in-Teamleader-Focus) you'll need to fill these out in this screen as well before you can continue. 

- Click on **Add project.** Now you get to the project page. You will notice there is a **header **on top.

Fill in the fields as this will give you a clear overview of the most important information about the project. Click on the **three ****dots **in the top right-hand corner to find the following options:
![Project header and actions menu in Teamleader Focus showing project details and management options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/35961107036177)

 

If you have different types of projects and you want to categorise them you can colour code them by clicking on **Change ****colour**.

- There are 4 default fields in the header: Owners, Customers, Assignees and Price. You can add extra fields to the header by clicking the **three ****dots **in the top right-hand corner > **Customise header.**
You can also find and display all of your project **custom ****fields **right here.

*Notes:*

Keep in mind you are editing the header for every user opening that project. So each project can have a different header, but all users will see the same header for that project.

- New projects will take over the same header and column setup from your most recent project. This means you don't need to customise every new project to your preferred setup: instead it will take over the setup of the most recent project that you are the owner of. Duplicated projects however would still use the same setup as the original project.

- 
**Manage preferences** gives you the opportunity to define access/edit rights in a project. Discover more information about that [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project). You can also set up your budget preferences. [Read more here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/38494698372881-How-To-Manage-your-project-budget-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Click on **Set user rates **to set custom user rates per project. Find more information [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695878909713-FAQ-Can-I-set-custom-user-rates-per-project).
 

- Click on **View timesheet** to access an overview of the time tracking linked to your project. Time trackings can be edited from here as well, unless they have already been billed to the customer.
*Note**: Only accessible for *[*project owners*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project)* with access to time tracking.*

- Choose **Export timesheet **if you for example want to send your customers an update on the time tracking of a project without creating an invoice first. Or select this option to have an internal overview of the time already spent.

This option is only accessible to [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)or project owners

- You can export a report both to PDF and Excel

- Pick a language to match the language of your customer

- 
**Download PDF report:** Quickly generate custom PDF reports to share project information. Choose which groups you want to download a report of, and what to include in the report, like time tracking or budgeting. 
 

- 
**Mark **your project **as template **if you often reuse the same type of projects. Note that you can only do this if the project is closed. [Read more here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/27877954273297-How-To-Project-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- 
**Duplicate **the project. Read all about that [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695832552593-How-To-Duplicate-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- 
**Close **or **Delete **the project.

Closed projects cannot be selected anymore when adding tasks, time trackings, deals or invoices later on.  

When closing a project, you have the option to immediately mark all open work as completed:
![Confirmation dialog for closing a project in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695548998289)

- You can always reopen the project afterwards.

- Deleting a project is permanent, and you can’t recover it anymore via the [recycle bin](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692945321105-FAQ-How-does-the-recycle-bin-work).

- By clicking on **Hide ****details**, you can hide the header.

- An **owner **is responsible for the project, they receive notifications and have more rights than an **assignee **(participant). Read more about the different rights in a project [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project). *Note that an *[*admin *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)*will always have the same rights as an owner, even though they are not set as an owner.*

- An important field in the header is the **billing ****method**, you have three choices:

**Time and materials**: If you choose this option, you will invoice the billable time and materials in the project.

- 
**Fixed ****price**: It doesn't matter how much time or money you actually spend on the project, you simply invoice the budget you set out initially.

- 
**Non-billable**: You have the option to set the entire project as non-billable, which means that all time tracking for that project is non-billable by default.

- Whatever billing method you pick in the header, this will become the default billing method for the whole project. Find more information on the billing method of a project [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695653109393-How-To-Billing-methods-in-a-project).

- Via the header, you can add a **start and/or end date** to your project. When editing the start or end date of a project or group, you will get the option to move all underlying dates along as well. This comes in very handy after [duplicating a project](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695832552593-How-To-Duplicate-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus) for example.

 

- Below the header, you can find the ‘**Work ****breakdown**’ tab. This is where you will structure your project. You can add groups, tasks, materials and meetings to your project. Groups will help you categorise your project.

Add a group by clicking on **Add ****group**.

Add a title. If you click the group again, you can add assignees to it. The ones you add here will be auto assigned in the header.

- Add the start and end date.

- Since we want to keep the project module flexible, it is possible to pick a different billing method for the group than the default billing method you chose in the header.

- Add a task by clicking on **Add ****task **or **+Add line.**

Add a title. If you click the task, you can select the [work type.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691899451153-FAQ-Can-I-add-extra-work-types)

- You can also add an assignee or multiple assignees to the task.

All assignees added to a task in the project will automatically appear in the assignees field in the header.

- You can filter on multiple assignees next to the ‘show all’ field in the Work Breakdown overview.

- Fill in the start and end date.
*Note: *Newly added tasks will have their dates prefilled with the dates of their direct parent (project or group).

- Even though you selected a project or group billing method in the header, you can still set a specific billing method for your task.

- Add time tracking on a task by clicking on a task and opening the side panel, and then:

Clicking on +Add time tracking. Here you can decide if the time tracking should be billable or not; this makes it possible for example to add non-billable timetracking to billable tasks.

- Clicking on Start timer. This starts a timer with all the information of the task prefilled, which is a huge time saver!

All time tracked on a task will be visible via a progress bar too(provided you filled out the 'Time estimated' field): 
![The Planning section of a task showing start/end dates, estimated time, and tracked time progress.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695549048849)

- 
*Notes*:

Adding a task to a project will automatically link the customer of the project to that new task.

- No task on a project yet to track time on? No problem! A new task can be added to a project from the time tracking dialogue (In a project, click on the + in the top right-hand corner > Time tracking > Task > New task).

- Add a material by clicking on the arrow next to **Add ****task **> **Add material** or **+Add line**.

Start typing to select a product from your product catalogue, or just type a title

- Set the quantity

- When selecting a product from your products:

You'll also be able to view the remaining [stock ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691712397713-How-To-Stock-management-in-Teamleader-Focus)of your product.

- The description, product unit, unit price and unit cost are taken over, but these can of course be edited.

- Fill in the start and end date
*Note: *Newly added materials will have their dates prefilled with the dates of their direct parent (project or group).

- Choose the billing method

Find more information on adding materials to your project and invoicing them [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695860078353-How-To-Add-products-to-your-project-and-invoice-them).

- You can also enter a negative unit price for your material, unless it's a non-billable material. Negative materials can be used to give discounts in your project. This also means that a group and even a complete project can be negative in price.

- 
Add a meeting by clicking on the arrow next to **Add task > Add meeting **or **+Add line.**

A meeting placeholder will be added to your project. A placeholder is actually a great way to already allocate resources for meetings, without adding an actual meeting yet. It allows you to plan a meeting in advance without having all the details yet for example.

- Next to the meeting placeholder, you'll find an exclamation mark stating no meeting has been added yet. You'll also see this reflected in the status of the item:
![A task list in Teamleader Focus showing a warning for a meeting placeholder with no meeting linked.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695549117969)

- Click on the placeholder to add a meeting to it. You can choose between an already existing meeting or create a new meeting.

- When a meeting is marked as done, the status of the meeting placeholder will be updated to 'Done' as well. You can't manually change the status here.

- By marking a meeting as done, you can track time on it as well.

- You can also add **work orders **to your project. Read more about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696177810449-How-To-Add-a-work-order-to-a-project).

- And not only that; after adding your items to your work breakdown, you an always **inline edit **them easily afterwards instead of having to completely reopen the item. Just click anywhere on the line item and change your title, assignees, status, start and end date etc.:
![A task list in Teamleader Focus showing articles under an administration group with edit options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695518264465)

- To improve the flexibility of the project module, you can **drag and drop** groups, tasks, materials and meetings to alter the order or move something to another group.
![Reordering tasks within a project group using drag-and-drop in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692948548241)

- Depending on how things are going, you can change the **status **of the tasks and materials to: To do, In progress, On hold, Done. Note that the statuses are also colour coded. It's also possible to filter the work breakdown on status:
![Status filter dropdown in the Work breakdown tab of a Teamleader Focus project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695556820625)
This way, you don't clutter your work breakdown with work that has already been done for example. This filter works in combination with the type and assignee filter. Also, [when you're invoicing work](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus), it's handy to only invoice work that is marked as done for example.

- You can add **columns **to and delete them from the work breakdown overview. In order to do that, click on the cogwheel and add all the columns you want.
![The work breakdown view in a Teamleader Focus project with the column selection menu open.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695534978705)

It is possible to scroll horizontally to see all information if you have too many columns.

- Also note that you can always **duplicate **tasks, materials, meetings and groups one by one or altogether:

One by one by clicking on the three dots next to the item > Duplicate:
![Context menu options for a task in a list, highlighting the 'Duplicate task' action.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695556913041)

- Select the whole group or several items by checking the box next to it:
![Bulk actions toolbar and item selection in a Teamleader Focus project or quotation list.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695573119633)
 

- You can **merge ****groups **by dragging one group and dropping it into the other:
![Confirmation dialog for merging two groups in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695573173009)
 

- Lastly, you can execute some **bulk actions b**y checking the boxes next to multiple items in the work breakdown. 
[*! Note that you either need to be an admin or you need admin access or edit access to a project.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project)
![Bulk edit options for selected items in a list, showing actions like Add assignees and Update status](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/35899244126865)
 

Add assignees: add assignees to selected items in the work breakdown, on top of the ones that were already present

- Replace assignees: replace the assignee(s) from the selected items in the work breakdown

- Unassign: delete the assignee(s) from the selected items in the work breakdown

- Update status

- Move to a group: select the destination group you want to move the items to

*Notes:*

Assignees of meeting lines and mileages can't be edited in bulk.

- The status of meetings lines cannot be updated because they are based on the status of the meeting (meeting done or not).

- The status of a group can't be updated because a group doesn't have a status.
 

- Next to the Work breakdown tab there's the 'Kanban' tab. The Kanban view on a project is focused on the statuses of project tasks & materials, allowing you to see the status of these items at a glance and determine which tasks should receive attention first. [Read all about it here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696036676241-How-To-The-Kanban-view-on-a-project)

- Next to the Kanban view we have the ‘**Project ****info**’ tab:

In 'Project health', you find an overview on budget spent, margin and budget remaining. [Find more information here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/38494698372881-How-To-Manage-your-project-budget-in-Teamleader-Focus#h_01K3R7HHR1PERJYT45K7GYQYC8)
![Project health dashboard showing budget, time, unbilled amounts, margin, and pending work metrics.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/38499801836817)

 

- There's also a 'Description' field to provide more details about your project.
![Warning message in Teamleader Focus indicating a resource conflict for a specific time slot.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692241813905)

- Below the Description you'll find the field 'Customers', with an overview of the customers linked to your project. You'll be able to add a **Primary customer **to your project by clicking on the star icon next to the name of a customer:

This will be the default linked customer for new tasks, time trackings and invoices on the project.

- The primary customer of a project will be indicated in bold in the customer data fields.

- 
**External parties**: Link external stakeholders (e.g. subcontractors, partners) to a project without affecting billing or customer logic. Add contacts/companies and assign functions or sub functions. Easily edit or remove them in this menu, and see them listed on the contact/company pages. The external parties are also included in Excel exports and can be optionally duplicated via project templates.

- 
**Linked expenses:** You can easily link an expense to a project. By connecting these costs to the right projects, you maintain accurate budgets and gain better insight into your project profitability. [Learn all about how it works here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/40881863028113-How-To-Link-an-expense-to-a-project)

- Below Linked expenses you'll find an overview of the **Files **that have been added to this project. Or easily add new files here.

- At the bottom of the page, you'll find 'Activities':
![The Activities feed in Teamleader Focus showing a timeline of project updates and actions.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695535298193)

When a project is created, closed, reopened or renamed this will be mentioned here

- Notes can be added as well

- The third tab on the project page is the ‘**Invoices**’ tab, in which you can invoice your project or find the invoices attached to your project. Read all about invoicing a project [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

### Note

In **Settings > Projects > Preferences **admins can choose to enable two extra fields in projects:

- 
Allow setting a cost budget
The cost budget of a project is a threshold set by the project owner for the total Cost on a project.
Use this if you want to make sure the total cost on the project stays within a certain threshold.

- 
Allow setting a time budget
The time budget of a project is a threshold set by the project owner for the total Time tracked on a project.
Use this if you want to make sure the total time tracked on the project stays within a certain threshold.

 

## Project overview

When navigating to your project module, you can find all your projects in a handy overview. This is valuable as it allows for effective follow-up on open or ongoing projects and enables efficient filtering according to some specific criteria. Read more about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695851989905-How-To-The-projects-overview-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

Next to a list overview of your projects, you can also find them on a timeline. [Read all about the timeline view in projects.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696110215441-How-To-The-timeline-view-in-projects)
