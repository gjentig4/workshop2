# FAQ: Can I set custom user rates per project?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089)  

If the [billing method on your project](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695653109393-How-To-Billing-methods-in-a-project) is set to 'Time and Materials', then the user rates you want to apply for your time tracking may vary depending on the project. Good news! It's possible to set custom user rates per project that differ from the default user rates which you've set in your settings. Read this article to learn all about custom user rates.

 

First of all, you define the external price of your employees in your settings. Find more information on how to do that [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691956252177-How-To-Setting-different-types-of-hourly-rates).

These rates will be applied by default when you've selected 'Time and Materials' as a billing method. Follow these steps to set custom user rates per project. Note that only [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)or [project owners](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project) can set custom user rates, other users won't be able to see this option.

- Go to your **project**

- Click on the **three ****dots **in the top right-hand corner

- Choose **Set user rates**
**![Project actions menu in Teamleader Focus with 'Set user rates' highlighted.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695857147025)**

- In the next screen, you'll see all assignees of the project together with their default external price. Adapt their user rates by clicking on the boxes next to their names and inserting another rate.
![The 'Set user rates' dialog box for configuring hourly billing rates per team member in a project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695895745681)

- Optionally you can historically update the rates of all the unbilled time trackings for this project.

- Click on **Save rates**.

 

*Note: G*ood to know is that custom user rates are also included when [duplicating the project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695832552593-How-To-Duplicate-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus)
