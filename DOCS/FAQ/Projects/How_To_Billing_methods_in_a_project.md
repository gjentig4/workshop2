# How To: Billing methods in a project

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

 

*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually in the upcoming months, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089)******
  

When adding a project to Teamleader Focus you can define how you want to bill it to your customer. You can choose a billing method for the whole project, for the group or for a specific item (task or material). Read all about it here.

 

## Some definitions

- 
**Budget** = This is the estimated budget for the project set by the customer.

- 
**Cost budget** = This is the estimated budget for the project you set yourself.

- 
**Price **= This is what the customer is going to pay.

- 
**Cost **= This is what the cost of the project is going to be, based on the internal rate of the assignee(s) linked to the project. This can be set in Settings > Users. Find more information [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695715407761-How-To-Define-the-internal-cost-of-your-employees).

 

## Billing method preferences

First of all, [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)can decide which billing methods should be available in your account for certain project items, and set a default billing method for projects, groups, tasks, materials and meetings. Go to **Settings **> **Projects > Billing method preferences**:

![The Billing method preferences menu in Teamleader Focus project settings.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/30787130747921)
 

Click on the **pencil **next to one of the options, e.g. project billing methods:
![The Project billing methods dialog in Teamleader Focus for selecting available and default methods.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/30787130756369)

- Check the boxes next to the billing methods you want to make available.
*Editing this does not retroactively change or remove the billing method of existing project lines.*

- Choose a default billing method. After setting the default method, all newly created projects will have this billing method by default, also when converting a quotation or a deal into a project.

*E.g. when converting a quotation to a fixed price project, the price of a quotation will be the exact price of the project.*

- *Changing the default billing method does not retroactively change the billing method of existing project lines.*

 

## Billing method for a project
![Project header in Teamleader Focus showing billing method selection and budget overview.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/37571096342801)

- 
**Time and materials**: The default billing method for a project, based on all time and materials in a project. The ‘Price’ is based on the sum of all underlying prices and can't be edited by you. The '[Budget](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/38494698372881-How-To-Manage-your-project-budget-in-Teamleader-Focus)' field however can be adapted. If you invoice the project, the invoice will show all billable time and material.

- 
**Fixed price**: A fixed price for the whole project is set. Underlying work will not have an individual price, but instead will have ‘Budget spent’, which is an indication on how well the fixed price is working out. It is still possible to add price “on top” of the fixed price of a project. Even if you work with a fixed budget and don't invoice tracked time as such, these budget calculations can still be useful - be it for internal reporting, or checking whether the budget you set out initially was realistic.
Unlike 'Time and materials', here the 'Price' field can be adapted whereas the 'Budget' field is not adaptable.

- 
**Non-billable**: The whole project is non-billable. There are no prices or invoice options. Costs and their relation with ‘Cost budget’ becomes more important to monitor.

 

Which fields are visible in the project header will completely depend on the chosen billing method. E.g. for ‘Fixed price’ and ‘Non-billable’ the field ‘Budget’ won’t be visible. 

 

## Billing method for a group

The groups you'll add later on will have the same billing method of the project by default, but you can of course change that by editing the group. Group billing methods work similar as Project billing methods, with the added method of Project fixed price.

 

![The billing method dropdown menu within the Budget section of a Teamleader Focus project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695666354961)

- 
**Time and materials:** The price is based on the sum of all underlying prices.

- 
**Fixed ****price**: A fixed price for the whole group is set. Underlying work will not have an individual price, but instead will have ‘Budget spent’, which is an indication on how well the fixed price is working out. It would still be possible to add price “on top” of the fixed price of a project.

- 
**Project fixed price:** The price is already included in the project fixed price. ‘Budget spent’ is based on the external rate and is purely indicative. (*This is only available if the project has the billing method fixed price*).

- 
**Non-billable**: The whole group is non-billable. 

 

## Billing method for tasks and materials

### Tasks

You can also specify the billing method for a specific task:![Selecting a billing method in the Budget section of a Teamleader Focus project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695666437137)

 

- 
**User rate**: Price is based on the [rate of the users](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695715407761-How-To-Define-the-internal-cost-of-your-employees) that tracked time.

- 
**Work type rate**: Price is based on the rate of the work type.

- 
**Custom rate**: Price is based on a custom set rate for the task.

- 
**Fixed price:** Price of the task is fixed and is not dependent on the rate or time tracked.

- 
**Project fixed price**: Price is already included in the project fixed price. Budget spent is based on the external rate and is purely indicative. (*This is only available if the project has the billing method fixed price).*

- 
**Non-billable:** This task cannot be billed and therefore has no price.

 

### Materials

You can also specify the billing method for a specific material:

![The billing method dropdown menu within the Budget section of a project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695666510353)

- 
**Unit price**: Price is based on the unit price of a material and its quantity.

- 
**Fixed price**: Price of the material is fixed and is not dependent on the unit price or quantity.

- 
**Project fixed price**: Price is already included in the project fixed price. Budget spent is based on the external rate and is purely indicative. (*This is only available if the project has the billing method fixed price).*

- 
**Non-billable**: This material cannot be billed and has therefore no price.
