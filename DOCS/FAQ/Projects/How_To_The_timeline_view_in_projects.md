![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

 

*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089) 

With the project timeline view in Teamleader Focus we assist you and your team in creating a pragmatic and high-level timeline view. Read all about it here!

## Why

The timeline view in Teamleader Focus allows you to effortlessly **check across multiple projects** when they are planned to start and when they’re due. A few of the many advantages are:

- You can continuously see how occupied the business is

- Easily assess if you can take on more work

- Immediately check and filter on the status of each project

- Discover gaps or tight spots in your planning easier and get your team pulling in the same direction

 

## Where

You find the timeline view by navigating to the overview of your **Projects **and clicking on the **icon ****switch **in the top right-hand corner. Via this button, you can easily switch between the list view and the timeline view.

    ![The 'Add project' button and view toggle icons in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696054992657)
  

 

The last selected view is saved here. This means that if you leave the timeline to navigate to a company for example, the timeline view will still be in place when returning to your **Projects**. Same goes for the list view of your projects.

 

## Timeline specifics

- Opening the timeline loads all of your projects, and you’ll be able to scroll down to access all of them

- At the top, choose a Days or Months view 
![Project planning navigation bar with view toggles and 'Add project' button](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696040730001)

Choose 'Months' for a zoomed out and more high-level overview

- The name of the month is displayed at the top of the timeline

- Navigate from one month to the next by moving the bar at the bottom of the page to the left or the right

- In the 'Days' view, workdays and weekends are displayed in a different colour 

- The projects are sorted starting at the top with the one that was **most recently added** on the first track of the timeline

- When you **click **on a project in the left, you’ll be redirected to the project page

- The **colours **of your project are taken over from the colour you assigned to them on the project detail page (via the three dots in the top right-hand corner > Choose colour).
*Note: if either the start or end date of the project isn't filled out, the bar won't be filled in full colour, advising you to fill out the missing information. Before:*

*After: ![Project planning view showing project name, dates, and timeline bar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696055113617)*

- If a project has groups, an **arrow **appears next to the project title on the left. Click on the arrow to expand its groups and view them on the timeline:

![Project planning timeline view with a side panel showing details for 'Project 68'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696040898577)

- 
**Drag & drop projects and groups** in their track to **edit their start and end date**
Adjust the time period of your project by extending or shortening it
![Resizing a project block in the project planning timeline view using the drag handle.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696069972625)
! Only [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)and [users with admin access to projects](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project) can edit start and end dates. If you have none of these rights, you cannot do this. Even if you are the owner of a project, you have to navigate to the project itself to edit it.

- 
**Inline add or edit the start and end date** of a project right from this view:

### Search bar, filtering & statuses

The search bar, the different project statuses and filters allow you to find certain projects faster.

 

#### Search bar

In the top left-hand corner of your timeline you’ll find the search bar. Search within your projects on the name of a customer for example and filter on only the projects of this specific customer.

 

#### Status

    You can also search your projects based on their status:
    ![Project list view filters and search bar in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696041026961)
  

 

- All projects

- Open projects

- Planned projects: 
Projects that are planned and have a start date that is later than today.

- Ongoing projects
Projects with a start date in the past and an end date in the future.

- Closed projects

 

#### Filters

- Overdue

- Over budget

- Billable

 

#### 
*Note*: The timeline also takes user rights into account. Users that don't have access to certain projects can’t see them in the timeline either.

 

**You can filter on all of the above filters at the same time.** So you could take a look at all projects in a certain status and for a certain customer for example.
