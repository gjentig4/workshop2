# How To: Duplicate a project in Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695784958097)

 

***This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089)  

Want to reuse the same project just once without having to make use of project templates? Then you can duplicate a project! Save time and money and achieve your goals faster. Read all about it here.

 

# How

- Go to the **project **you’d like to duplicate

- Click on the **three ****dots **in the top right-hand corner

- Click on **Duplicate ****project**
**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28441690825745)**

 

# What

Automatically, a new project is created with the same title +copy as the one you duplicated it from. E.g. ‘Installing shower cabinet **- copy**’. You can easily adjust the title here:

Most elements are taken over from the original project:

- The structure of the project

- Groups

- Tasks

- Materials
*Note*: the status of tasks and materials isn't included in the duplicate and will always be reset to 'To do'.

- Meetings: the meetings itself aren't duplicated but the meeting placeholders are.

- Column setup

- 
[Custom user rates](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695878909713-FAQ-Can-I-set-custom-user-rates-per-project) (when defined)

 

Things that aren’t taken over from the original project:

- Linked deals

- Linked quotations

- Linked invoices

 

## Duplicating groups/tasks/materials/meetings

Note that you can also duplicate tasks, materials, meetings or groups of a project instead of the whole project.

You can do this one by one or altogether:

- One by one by clicking on the three dots next to the item > **Duplicate**:

- Select the whole group or several items by checking the box next to it:

## Project templates

Duplicating a project is a handy feature if you want to reuse a project just once. If you consistently need to work with the same types of projects then we advise you to work with project templates.
