# How To: How is Amount unbilled calculated in the project overview?

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)
The *amount unbilled *in the project overview is the total amount of all project work that is (partially) billable but has not yet been invoiced. Read all about it here.
 

The amount unbilled consists of:

- 
**Time and materials:** the price of (partially) billable lines, calculated as *hourly rate × tracked time*. 

- 
**Fixed price:** the price of (partially) billable fixed price lines.
 

# What is taken into account to calculate this amount?

- The amount of **non-booked project invoices** (draft).
 

- Amounts from **advance invoices**.
 

- Amounts from **manually created invoices** (not based on project lines).
 

*Note: If you have already invoiced more than is billable in the project, the amount unbilled in the project overview will display €0 and not a negative amount.*
 

# What is *not* taken into account to calculate this amount?

- 
**Time tracking on billable tasks that were not marked as billable when the time was tracked.**
Those hours still count as internal project costs, but they do *not* increase the billable amount.
 

- The **task or material status** (To do, In progress, Done) has **no impact** on the amount unbilled.
 

# Price vs. unbilled amount: what’s the difference?

The **Price** column in a project represents the total amount per line, group, or project based on fixed price and all tracked billable time & materials.

The **Amount** **unbilled** in the project overview and exports shows that same price, **minus all (draft) invoices already created**. This means it reflects only the part of the work that still needs to be invoiced.
