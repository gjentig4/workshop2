Tracking project costs can sometimes get complicated, but Teamleader Focus is here to simplify it for you! In this article, we will walk you through how to add extra costs, such as materials and mileage, to your project through time tracking. You’ll also learn how these costs are reflected in the project and where to make adjustments when needed.

 

[*Please contact us *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065)*if you don't see the option to add extra costs in your account.*
 

# Add extra costs

Follow these steps to add extra costs to your project:

- Click on the **plus icon** in the top right-hand corner of your account

- Choose **Time tracking**

- Fill out your time tracking and **select your project and task**

- 
Check the box next to ‘Add materials to project in next step’

- Click on **Confirm**

- 
Navigate to your project and you’ll see that the material(s) have been added to the work breakdown of your project. 
*Note: you can always edit the material afterwards from here.*

- 
After adding the material, the assignee and the date of the material will be automatically filled in. The date will be taken from the date of the time tracking.
 

## Note

You won’t be able to add extra costs to your time tracking from the:

- project side panel directly in your project 

- [planning module](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696175894929-How-To-Planning-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- 
[‘Add multiple time trackings’ dialog](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)
 

In these cases you’ll need to add the material(s) manually on your project.
 

# Add mileage

You can also add mileages on meetings linked to a project by following these steps:

- 
Go to your project and take a look at your linked meetings. Or if you don’t have a linked meeting yet, add a meeting placeholder and then a meeting.

- **Mark the meeting as done**

- 
**Add travel distance** to the meeting
