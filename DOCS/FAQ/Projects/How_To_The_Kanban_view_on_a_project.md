*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089) 

The Kanban method is a method with an emphasis on visualising work, allowing you to easily follow-up on your project. Read all about the Kanban view on a project here.

## 

What

By utilising Kanban boards, you gain real-time insights into your workflow, enabling effective communication and quick identification of bottlenecks.

 

The Kanban view on a project is focused on the **statuses **of project tasks & materials, allowing you to see the status of these items at a glance and determine which tasks should receive attention first. 

 

In a project, you can navigate to the ‘Kanban’ tab, next to the ‘Work breakdown’. 

- In the top left-hand corner you can find a **filter **on ‘Type’ or on ‘Assignees’, ensuring you can follow-up on the information that is relevant to you. 

- 
**Drag and drop** the tiles from one column to another to change the statuses of your tasks and materials. 

- The statuses of tasks/materials are **colour-coded**, but aren’t customisable

- Smoothly **add tasks and materials** from here via the button in the top right-hand corner of your Kanban view

- Clicking on a tile opens the **side panel** in which you can edit all relevant fields

- Note that **meetings **or meeting placeholders do not end up in this overview
