# Why

Project templates in Teamleader Focus are a game-changer for **efficiency **and consistency. When you frequently manage **similar types of projects**, templates save you from the hassle of starting from scratch each time. By reusing a **predefined layout**, you can quickly set up new projects with all the necessary tasks, meetings, and materials already in place. 

 

This not only streamlines your workflow but also ensures that every project follows a **standardised structure**, reducing errors and ensuring nothing is overlooked. With project templates, you can focus more on delivering great results and less on repetitive setup tasks.

 

Additionally, you can easily **add quotation items** to a **project generated from a template.**

 

# Creating a template

First of all, to be able to *create *project templates you need to:

- Be an [admin user](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) or;

- As a non-admin, have admin access to projects
![Project access level settings in Teamleader Focus user permissions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27888629750801)

 

Secondly, only [**closed projects**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695560896145-How-To-Add-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus#:~:text=Close%C2%A0or%20Delete%C2%A0the%20project.) can be marked as a template.

- If a project template has to be created from an active project, a good workaround is to [duplicate ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695832552593-How-To-Duplicate-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus)that active project, close it and then mark it as a template.

 

To create a project template, follow these steps:

- Go to the **project **you want to mark as a template

- 
**Close **it

- Go to the **three dots **in the project header and choose **Mark as template**
**![The project actions dropdown menu in Teamleader Focus with 'Mark as template' highlighted.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27888632837777)**

 

- Specify what should be taken over from the template

Notes

**Budgets**: if you choose to take over budgets as well, know that if you create a new project out of a template and you then increase or decrease the budget of the project/group, you’ll receive a warning like this one where you can choose to proportionally increase or decrease the budgets in your project lines, or choose to keep the current values:
![A dialog box to update budgets of project lines proportionally after a project budget increase.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27888632848017)

- 
**Meetings**: only the meeting placeholder will be copied, and not the meeting itself.

- 
**Start/end date** of the project: the same time period gets proportionally changed for a new project from this template. E.g. there’s a week between the start and end date of your project, then there also be one week between start and end date in the new project.

- 
**Statuses **of items like tasks aren’t copied, meaning the status of items in the new project will always be on ‘To do’.

 

- 
**Save **the template.

There’ll be a label ‘Template’ next to the project title ![Project template header showing owners and auto-assigned assignees](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27888629768721)

- Also in the project overview you’ll see the above label, and admin users + users with admin access to projects can find their templates back by going to the project overview and filtering on Project status > ’Template':
![The filtering interface in Teamleader Focus showing a project status filter set to 'Template'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33173617472785) 

- All templates can also be found in **Settings** > **Projects** > Project templates.

 

# Editing a template

When a project is marked as a template, any changes made to it will be applied to future projects created with this template.
![Project template header in Teamleader Focus showing template status and auto-assigned users.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27888629775761)

 

- 
**Configure template preferences**: only admins and users with admin access to a project will be able to view templates and edit the template preferences.

 

# Deleting a template

To delete a template, you have to ‘unmark’ it as a template. 

- Go to the project template

- Click on the **three dots **in the top right-hand corner

- Choose **Unmark as template**

 

# Converting a quotation to a project from a template

You can also add lines from a quotation to a project generated from a template. Follow these steps:

- Start from a quotation

- 
**Convert **it to a project

- In the top right-hand corner, click on the **arrow **next to ‘Create new project’

- Choose **Create from template**
**![The action menu for creating a project from selected quotation lines in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27888629779217)**

- Choose a project template

- Click on **Add**

- The quotation items will be added as **additional project lines** to the project created from a template.
[*Note regarding multi-currency:*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692864101137-How-To-Multi-currency-in-Teamleader-Focus) if another currency is used in your quotation then in the project, then if you add the quotation lines to the selected project template, the currency symbol of the project lines will be updated to match the project template, but the amounts will stay the same.
