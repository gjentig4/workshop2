# Migrate to our new project module

*It's possible you don't see the option to migrate to our new project module in your account yet, as *[*not all project functionalities are currently available*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696107729809-Old-projects-vs-new-projects)*. We're working hard on giving everyone the option to migrate, so stay tuned to find more information on this soon!*

 

*Did you switch from an old pricing plan to our SMART, GROW or FLOW package? Then you have to add the Project management Booster to your licence first. *[*Find more information here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696169462161-How-To-Add-remove-Boosters-from-your-license-SMART-GROW-FLOW)

 

For years, our customers have successfully used Teamleader Focus to manage (and invoice) their projects. Yet we've noticed that a lot of customers have different workflows. We therefore developed a brand-new projects' module, in which you can define your own workflow. More flexibility, operational efficiency and an improved cash flow are among the things you can achieve with the new projects. Read this article to learn how to migrate to the new module.

 

The module is based on three pillars:

- Operational efficiency: the new projects in Teamleader Focus are time-saving.

- Flexibility: projects adapt to your own way of working.

- Improved cash flow: bill the tasks and materials you want to whenever you want to, while always keeping a clear overview on the profitability of your project.

## Differences and improvements

Let’s dive into a project to discuss the biggest differences and improvements. 

- 
**Project header:** Once the project is created, you will immediately notice a big visual difference. At the top of the page there is a header. It can be customised to show the information that is relevant to you, including Custom Fields. Want to colour code your project? You can!

- 
[**Work breakdown overview**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695560896145-How-To-Add-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus). This overview can also be customised with the columns you want to see.

- 
**Groups**: In the new projects, we refer to groups instead of phases. In your current projects, you have to add a phase before being able to add a task to your project. Now, project lines such as tasks, materials, and meetings can all be added separately.

- 
**Drag & drop: **To manage your project more smoothly, you can easily drag and drop** **items around or assign them to a group. It is even possible to merge groups.

- 
**Duplication**: You can select groups or project lines and [duplicate them, or you can duplicate an entire project](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695832552593-How-To-Duplicate-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus). Thanks to all these features, you won’t waste time on manual actions.

- 
**Billing methods:** Billing options have become more flexible. You can select a [**billing method**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695653109393-How-To-Billing-methods-in-a-project) in the project header. This becomes the default method for the whole project. But you can also set a different billing method per group, task, material and meeting.

- An interesting improvement is that **time tracking** is now added to a **task**. Since you can bill project lines separately, you can just bill a task - and time tracking - in an ongoing project.

- 
**Price **and **budget **have a new meaning in the new projects. Price is what your end customer pays. Cost is the internal cost for your company. Budget on the other hand is a way to set limits and warnings in the projects. Budget will help you make sure you don’t exceed the price that was agreed upon with your customer. Cost budget will help you keep track of the internal cost.

- 
**Status & filters**: To get a better overview of how well your project is performing, the new projects allow you to add a status to each project line. All project lines can be filtered based on type, status, and assignee. When invoicing the lines of a project via the invoicing tab, the filters come in very handy. This way you know what to invoice in one view.

- 
**Invoice your project(s):** In the project overview, you can [select projects and **invoice **them right away](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus). Use the smart filters to know which projects are ready to be invoiced. If you select the billable filter for example, you’ll get an overview of all the projects that can be invoiced.

- You can easily[ **convert your quotation** into a new project](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695713796625-How-To-Convert-a-deal-or-quotation-into-a-project), but the new projects also make it possible to add quotation lines to an already existing project.

 

## How to migrate

Ready to start using the new projects? Let’s go through the migration flow together. 

- Only [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)will be able to migrate to the new projects. There are no additional charges, the new projects are included in your pricing plan.

- Go to **projects**.

- Once you are in the project overview, you will see a **toggle **that allows you to preview your projects in the new view. By clicking this, you don’t migrate to the new projects yet. You can perform some actions in this preview mode like customising the header, but most aren't possible.

- Once you’ve visualised your projects in the new view, click the button **“Request switch”.**
**![Top navigation bar and project action buttons in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/38877579697041)**

- This will open a pop-up. Once your request is sent, customer support will contact you to guide you with your switch. Notice that the switch cannot be reversed!

 

Know that we're listening to your feedback and continuously working hard to add further improvements to our new project module. These will be added in the coming weeks as well!
