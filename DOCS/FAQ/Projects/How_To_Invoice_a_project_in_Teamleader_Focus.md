*******This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089)

# Via the invoices tab

You can invoice a project from the Invoices tab on the project detail page. 

Go to ‘Invoices’ and click on **Add ****invoice **in the top right-hand corner or click on +Add invoice:

**![The Invoices tab within a Teamleader Focus project showing financial overview and add invoice buttons.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695658385553)**

 

Now, you have three options: invoice project lines, create a blank invoice or create an advance invoice:

![The 'Add invoice for project' dialog showing options to create from lines, blank, or advance.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474372604177)

Make a choice and click on **Add ****invoice**.

 

## Create invoice from project lines

*Note that it's not possible to select project lines from multiple projects and merge these onto one invoice. You can only select project lines from the project you're currently in.*
 

In the next screen you can select which groups, tasks or materials you want to invoice. Optionally you can also choose to only *invoice up until a certain date.* When filled out, only the time trackings up until the selected date will be selected.
![Invoices tab in a project with a date filter for 'Invoice up until'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695653878929)

 

Select the items you want to invoice by checking the box next to them. Then, click on **Create ****invoice**:

**![Project invoicing screen showing billable tasks and materials grouped for invoice creation.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695674788881)**

- If you haven’t filled out a customer yet for the project you can select a customer here. If you’ve added multiple customers to your project you’ll have to choose which one of them you’re creating the invoice for. 

- 
There's also the option **Bundle groups. **
**![Project navigation tabs and invoice filtering options in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/30364945726225)**
Select this if you only want the group and not the work within a group to be shown on the invoice.
![Filtering and selecting items to invoice in Teamleader Focus with the 'Bundle groups' option.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/30364945730961)

Note that project lines without group will be shown on the invoice as usual.
 

Now, a draft invoice will be created. The behaviour is as follows:

- Groups become subtitles in the invoice, and task/materials become invoice items

- If your group has the [billing method](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695653109393-How-To-Billing-methods-in-a-project) fixed price, you can select which tasks and individual time trackings you want to mark as billed. Note that work that is part of a fixed price is not shown on the invoice, but you can add the time tracking report as an attachment to the related invoice.
*![Tooltip explaining that tasks linked to a fixed price project are hidden from the invoice.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/30364986951953)*

 

**Partial billing**

If the [billing method](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695653109393-How-To-Billing-methods-in-a-project) of your task/material/group is ‘Fixed price’, then it’s possible to only invoice part of the amount of the fixed price based on a **percentage**. 

When invoicing a fixed price, by default 100% will be filled out but you can easily adjust this percentage:
 

![The 'Invoices' tab in a Teamleader Focus project showing billable items and invoice creation.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695658599185)

 

**Negative invoices**

It is possible to create a negative invoice for a project based on negative material lines, as long as the invoice does not subtract any advance invoices. This allows you to create a credit invoice for a project where no advance was involved. If an invoice does subtract advance invoices, it cannot be made negative using this feature.
 

## Create blank invoice

You can also add a blank invoice to your project. This means that you just add an invoice that’s not linked to anything in the project (like time, materials or a fixed price).

Just fill out the fields like you would for a normal invoice:

![The 'Add Invoice' dialog box in Teamleader Focus for creating a new project invoice.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474372607633)
 

## Create advance invoice

The third option is to create an advance invoice. An advance invoice is a request for part of the payment before a product or service is delivered. 

You can deduct this advance invoice from later invoices linked to this project - for example invoices created from project lines. 

- Click on **Create advance invoice**

- Choose the specific amount or percentage of the project price for which you want to add an advance invoice.

- Click on **Add invoice.**

- By default, the checkbox next to 'Mark as advance invoice' is checked:
![The 'Add Invoice' form header showing customer selection and advance invoice options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474389497233)

- Fill out the items on your invoice

- **Save and book**

- You'll find the invoice in your overview with a label 'Advance invoice' next to it:
![The Invoices tab within a project view in Teamleader Focus, showing billing progress and status.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474372616977)
 

- In a later stage, you'll want to invoice the lines from your project as explained above. 
First select which project lines you want to bill. Then, you'll be able to deduct your advance invoice(s) from this amount by checking the box next to the advance invoice:
![The project invoicing interface in Teamleader Focus showing how to deduct advance invoices.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474372623505)

Choose how much from your advance invoices you want to deduct from your new invoice. You can either adapt the amount or edit the percentage:
![Input fields for deducting a specific amount or percentage from a total.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474372629137)

Make sure the advance invoice is already booked before using it to deduct.

- Total deduction from advance invoices can't be higher than total of billable amounts from selected project lines. Meaning that if the total billable amount from your project lines is €2000 already, then you can't deduct a higher advance invoice of e.g. €2500.

- You'll find the 'Amount to bill' of the new invoice in the top right hand-corner. If you click on the question mark next to 'Deduct advance invoices' you'll find how this amount is calculated.
![Tooltip explanation for deducting advance invoices in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/33474389517713)
 

- When you've selected everything, click on **Create invoice.**

- When you open your new invoice you'll see a remark has been added to the invoice stating that the advance invoice 'xxxx' has been added.
 

## Other ways to link an invoice to your project

There are some other ways to make sure your invoice is linked to your project and ends up in the ‘Invoices’ tab:

- Create an invoice through the menu 'Revenue > Invoices' directly, and via the button ‘Add invoice’ you can manually select the project

- Create a subscription linked to your project

 

# In bulk via the projects overview page

In the projects overview page, you can create invoices for multiple projects at once by clicking on the check mark next to your projects to select the ones you want to invoice > **Invoice X projects:**

![Bulk action to invoice multiple selected projects in the Teamleader Focus project overview.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/29387139139601)

 

*Notes:*

- Only projects with an unbilled amount can be invoiced.

- In the next screen to create your invoices, the primary customer of the project will be selected by default, but this can be changed.

- Projects without customer will be ignored and won't be visible in the 'Create invoices' screen.

- Every user with access to both the project module and the invoices module is able to create bulk invoices for projects.

 

# Credit notes

If you credit an invoice linked to a project, your credit note will also be visible in the project’s invoices tab:

![Invoices tab in a project showing financial summaries, invoices, and credit notes for a customer.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32290038263953)

- Billed and unbilled amounts update automatically when crediting an invoice linked to a project. That means the budget is recalculated when you credit a project invoice.

- Also partially credited invoices and their amounts will be displayed here and the billed/unbilled amounts will be updated accordingly.
