# How To: The projects overview in Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695803471377)

 

***This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/en/support/solutions/folders/7000008405)** 

When navigating to your project module, you can find all your projects in a handy overview. This is valuable as it allows for effective follow-up on open or running projects and enables efficient filtering based on project status.

## What

Find the list view of your projects by going to your projects and clicking on this icon:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695787264785)

You can customise your project overview by adding or deleting columns to the overview, or by filtering on the status of a project. It's also possible to create invoices in bulk for your projects from the projects overview.

 

### Column setup

Choose which columns you want to add to your overview by clicking on the **cogwheel **in the bottom right-hand corner:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695849949969)

E.g. easily add the columns ‘Price’, ‘Cost’ or ‘Margin’ if you want to find out how your projects are doing financially.

 

### Some definitions

- 
**Amount unbilled (excl.VAT)**: the open amount that is ready to be billed on the project.

- 
**Amount billed (excl.VAT)**: the amount already billed on the project (the sum of the linked invoices).

- 
**Amount paid (incl.VAT)**: the amount paid on the project (the sum of the paid amount of the linked invoices).

- 
**Time budget**: The limit of time that should be invested for the project, this can be set by the user.

- 
**Time estimated**: The sum of the estimated time of the tasks and meetings on the project.

- 
**Time tracked**: The sum of the time tracked on the project. If the time tracked exceeds the time budget, a warning will be shown next to it.

- 
**Progress**: This shows the status bar of the work on the project, allowing for a quick overview on how the work is progressing. You can hover over it to see more detailed info on the statuses of the work in the work breakdown.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32603960744849)

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/29387139135249)
 

**Save a filter**

It's also possible to save a filter to easily find certain information again. Important to know is that filters are user-specific. This means that filters created by you won't be visible in the account of your colleague and vice versa.

To save a filter, follow these steps:

- After creating a filter, click on **Save filter **in the top right-hand corner:
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32587932685969)
 

- In the next screen, enter a **name **for the filter in the title field.

This is a mandatory field

- By default, the name will be 'Project filters X'

- The name of the filter must be unique per user (if the name already exists, an error message will be shown)

- See a preview of the 'applied filters', showing all currently active filters:

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32604012902033)

- Click on **Save **to store the filter.
*Click on Cancel to return to the filter dialog without saving.*

- You can access your saved filters afterwards by navigating to the project overview and clicking on **Saved filters **next to the Filters button. The filters will be shown alphabetically and you can search through them.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32603960751249)

Click on a saved filter to use it and to make sure the filters are applied. Edit a filter by opening it. Add more lines to it, edit the lines, or delete lines. Make some changes and click on 'Update saved filter' when you're done.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/32603960753041) 
Click on the arrow next to the button 'Update saved filter' to either;

Save the edited filter as a new filter;

- Delete it

 

### Bulk invoice projects

Filters can also help you if you want to create invoices for multiple projects at once. This way you can e.g. invoice multiple projects for the same customer or projects with an end date in the same period.
 

Click on the check mark next to your projects to select the ones you want to invoice > Invoice X projects:

Next to a list overview of your projects, you can also find them on a timeline. [Read all about the timeline view in projects.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696110215441-How-To-The-timeline-view-in-projects)
