# FAQ: Can I export the time tracking of a project?

***This article describes functionality of our new project module. This module is being rolled out gradually, so it is possible you do not have access to the features described here yet. If that is the case, *[*you can still find documentation on the previous project module here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/25690691571089) 

When managing time tracking in projects, having the ability to export detailed timesheets and reports is essential for internal review, client communication, and invoicing. Fortunately, there are several ways to export time tracking of a project in Teamleader Focus. Read all about it here!

 

There are **five ways** to export the time tracking of a project:
 

# 1. **Export timesheet (PDF and Excel)**

Click on the **three dots **in the header of your project and choose **Export timesheet:**
**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/37214384329233)**

 

Choose this option if you for example want to send your customers an update on the time tracking of a project without creating an invoice first. Or select this option to have an internal overview of the time already spent.

- This option is only accessible to [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)or project owners

- You can export a report both to PDF and Excel

- Pick a language to match the language of your customer

 

**Notes**

- PDF: This report contains both the title of the related task and the description of the time tracking.

- Excel: This report only contains the description of the time tracking and not the title of the task. Since the task title is suggested automatically as the description, it will appear in the export if not deleted.

- For both PDF and Excel, we recommend you to add extra details to the description instead of replacing the description entirely if you want the information to appear in the export.
 

# 2. Download PDF report

Click on the **three dots **in the header of your project and choose **Download PDF report.** Quickly generate custom PDF reports to share project information. 

Choose the group (or all groups) you want to download a report of, and what to include in the report. Make sure 'Time tracking details' is enabled:

This PDF report contains both the title of the task and the description of the time tracking. 

 

# 3. Projects time spent (insights)

Consult the report ['Projects time spent](https://focus.teamleader.eu/insights/library-reports/ca95045e-d993-40d5-9e3b-996b7ac05cd9)' in your Insights to find an overview of whether projects are running within or over their budgeted time. Export this report via the 'Export to Excel' button in the top right-hand corner.

 

# 4. Export project time tracking via the project invoice

You can also export the time tracking of your project via the invoice you created for it. 

- [Invoice your project](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Go to the detail page of your invoice and click on the **three dots **next to 'Info'

- Choose **Time tracking report**

- Choose either **PDF** or **Excel** format.

**PDF report**: Offers more layout flexibility and allows selecting which time tracking details to include.

- 
**Excel report**: Does not allow column customisation and shows only the description of the time tracking, not the task title.

- The report can be attached to the invoice when sending to clients.

- Also note that the invoice itself will only show the task title or material—not the full time tracking description.

# 5. Export from Calendar > Tasks 

If you don't have time tracking in your account or your workflow just doesn't make use of it, there is an alternative way to export task-related time data:

- Go to **Calendar **> **Tasks**

- Create a **segment** with the rule “Project equals [project name]”.

- Export this segment to **Excel**. You can select which columns to include in the export, offering more flexibility.

This is especially useful when you want an overview of tasks per project without needing detailed time entries.
