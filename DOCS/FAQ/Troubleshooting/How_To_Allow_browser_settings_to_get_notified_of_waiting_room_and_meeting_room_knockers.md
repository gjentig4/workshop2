# How To: Allow browser settings to get notified of waiting room and meeting room knockers

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694882740241)

The waiting room feature offers the opportunity to let guests knock in a general waiting room and let you choose in which meeting room the meeting should happen. In order to notice knockers, it's important that browser settings like sound, pop-up windows & notifications are enabled!

If that's not the case, you will see one of the following notifications on your dashboard or meeting rooms overview:

# How do the notifications work?

There are 2 types of notifications: the browser pop-up and the sound notification.

- 
The browser notification will be visible at the right top (Mac) or the right bottom (windows) of your screen when someone is knocking on your waiting room.

*In the above examples another program, which is not visible, was the active program. The Lead capture Booster dashboard was opened in the back. Otherwise, the notification would not show, see explanation below.*

- The sound notification is the same as the sound when someone's knocking to join the meeting room, but will only be played once (4 seconds).

The notifications will only play if you don't have the dashboard/meeting rooms overview as the active tab. This means that another tab in your browser must be open or that you're working in a program other than your browser.

# How to enable the notifications per browser

If the message shows that notifications are not enabled, you can follow the steps below. Note that in most browsers, you'll need to allow notifications and sound for meeting.teamleader.eu!

If you haven't allowed (or denied) notifications for meeting.teamleader.eu before, you'll see a clickable link in the yellow message:

Click the link to open a pop-up where you can allow notifications for meeting.teamleader.eu.
