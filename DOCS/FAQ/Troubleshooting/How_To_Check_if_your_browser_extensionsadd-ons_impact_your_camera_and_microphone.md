Installing browser extensions or add-ons is often very handy. But they can impact your meeting experience in the Lead capture Booster. If you experience issues with connection to a microphone or camera, it might be that an extension is blocking this access.

To rule out which extension (there are millions of them available) is the bad guy, try opening the Lead capture Booster in a Private / Incognito window.

Most extensions are blocked in Private / Incognito windows so you can rule out whether it's an extension that is blocking your connections.

# Google Chrome extensions

- Visit chrome://extensions in your Chrome browser tab to get an overview of all your extensions.

- Check whether these extensions have access to your camera/microphone. This can interfere with the Lead capture Booster trying to access the same camera/microphone. Make sure to disable the extensions with microphone/camera access before joining an online meeting.

- Double check if the extensions are allowed in an Incognito window before you try the Lead capture Booster in an Incognito window.

# FireFox add-ons

- Visit about:addons in your FireFox browser tab to get an overview of all your add-ons

- Check whether these add-ons have access to your camera/microphone. This can interfere with the Lead capture Booster trying to access the same camera/microphone. Make sure to disable the add-ons with microphone/camera access before joining an online meeting.

- Double check if the add-ons are allowed in a Private window before you try the Lead capture Booster in a Private window
