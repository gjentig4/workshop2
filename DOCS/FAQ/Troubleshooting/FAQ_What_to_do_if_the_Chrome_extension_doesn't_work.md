Have you installed the Customer Meetings extension, but screensharing/cobrowse still doesn't work?

- If you want to share your screen in an incognito window, you should give the extension special permissions.

- If you are not in incognito mode, you should try to reinstall the extension.

In either case, follow the steps below:

- 
Open the Chrome extensions page: open the menu in the top right corner and choose Settings.
