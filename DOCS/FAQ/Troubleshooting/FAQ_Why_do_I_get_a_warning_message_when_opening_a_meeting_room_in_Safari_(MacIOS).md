# FAQ: Why do I get a warning message when opening a meeting room in Safari (Mac/IOS)?

**![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)**

***September 2022 update: Safari 16 does not have general issues for online meetings in the Lead capture Booster!***

In November 2020 [Apple released a new version](https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/macos-big-sur-release-date-3779573/) of the operating system (=Mac OS big sur) and updated IOS to version 14. This meant that Apple's native browser Safari was also updated in both systems.

Unfortunately, the first version of Big Sur and IOS 14 didn't work out well for WebRTC technology. This is the technology where the audio-, videoconferencing and screen share in the online meeting rooms is based on. It's the industry standard for web conferencing.

A robotic voice and inconsistent page crashes on Mac and audio issues on IOS were the main problems. The Lead capture Booster meeting rooms can't guarantee a smooth experience on Safari in those OS/IOS versions and therefore decided to install an informative banner.

We recommend using a different browser: Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Opera.
