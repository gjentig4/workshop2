![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

If you're visiting this help article, you've probably encountered a 'your session has expired' or a CSRF error in your Lead capture Booster meeting room.

![Teamleader Focus session expired and CSRF token error messages](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694769401489)

 

These messages mean that your browser couldn't create a secure cookie or couldn't access the cookie. This is probably caused by a plugin, an extension or a browser setting.

 

The CSRF error is mostly due to an older version of your browser or operating system, we highly recommend updating your browser and operating system to the latest version!

 

# How to fix this

Generally, you want to **make sure that cookies are enabled** in your browser. Cookies are necessary for a smooth meeting!Enable cookies in your browser settings:

- 
[Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/61416)

- 
[Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)

- 
[Safari](https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac) (mac) / [Safari](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/guides/how-to-enable-cookies/safari-iphone) (iPad/iPhone)

[Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies)

- 
[Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/search?query=enable%20cookies%20in%20edge)

If cookies are enabled in your browser but you still have the error after a page refresh, you can fix the CSRF error by following these steps:

- 
Try to open the meeting room in an incognito window or a different browser.If the CSRF error doesn't show, we recommend starting your meeting like this and fixing the issue in the original browser afterward.

- 
**Update your browser and operating system** to the latest version, and check if the CSRF error still happens.

- 
Check in your browser settings/preferences if the error is caused by an extension/add-on. Deactivate extensions/add-ons and refresh the meeting room to find the cause.

- 
If the CSRF error is not caused by an extension/add-on, check the privacy settings in your browser (see below).
