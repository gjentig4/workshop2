## Create a credit note from scratch

- Go to **Revenue**

- Select the tab **Credit notes**

- Click on **Add credit note**

- Fill in the necessary information

- Click on **Save**

 

**Important notes when creating this 'separate' (= not linked to an invoice) credit note:**

    - 
      It's not possible to link a separate credit note to an already existing
      invoice in Teamleader Focus by filling out the number of that invoice
      here. In order to do that, you'll need to follow the steps described
      below ("*Create a credit note from an existing invoice in Teamleader Focus*").
      If you fill out a number, there will only be a textual reference to the
      invoice number and not a functional one.
    

    - 
      If you fill in a date after the date of your first invoice in Teamleader Focus,
      Teamleader Focus will give you this error message: "You can only make
      credit notes without an invoice if the invoice date is before the date
      of the first invoice in Teamleader." Say your first invoice in Teamleader
      Focus was on 01/01/2018 for example, then you can only create separate
      credit notes prior to that date.
    

  
 

## Create a credit note from an existing invoice in Teamleader Focus

- Go to **Revenue > I****nvoices **and select the invoice you want to create a credit note for.

- Choose "Credit note" at the bottom of the top left box.
