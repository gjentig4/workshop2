## How does it work?

### Sending an invoice or a reminder manually:

- First of all, you need to enable the following toggle in your **Settings > Revenue > Preferences: **'Enable send by postal service'
![Preferences menu in Teamleader Focus showing invoice and subscription toggle settings.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691568384529)

- When sending an invoice or a reminder, you will get a pop up which now shows you the option '**Send via postal service'**. Click on it.

- If the address is available for that company or contact, it will be filled in here automatically. When changing the country, the availability of the service will be checked again.

- Choose the "Send type".

- Click "**Send invoice**". Make sure you have enough credits left in your [Teamleader Focus wallet.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691506715921-FAQ-What-can-I-do-with-the-credits-in-my-Teamleader-Focus-wallet)
![The 'Send invoice' dialog box in Teamleader Focus for configuring physical mail delivery.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691544001937)

- The invoice will then be printed out and sent via our postal service partners.

 

**Notes:**

- You can only send invoices within the respective country, e.g. invoices from Belgium to Belgium, not invoices from Belgium to France.

- Set up the automatic reminders under **Settings **> **Revenue **> **Automatic reminders for overdue invoices**

- Put the toggle next to "Send via postal service" on "**Yes**".

- Choose the "Send type".
 

**Notes:** 

- The request to send the automatic reminder will be processed by the postal service on the day itself and should be received one or two days later.

- In case the automatic sending fails, you will receive a notification and an error message will show up in the activities of the invoice:

#### Possible reasons for an automatic sending to fail:

- Sending an invoice via post is not available for your country.

- The sending option does not exist for your country (only for Dutch accounts).

- You did not have enough Teamleader Focus credits (only for Belgian and Dutch accounts).

- The address was invalid.
