# FAQ: Can invoices from subscriptions be sent automatically?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691763950609)

 

When you create a subscription, you have the option to book the invoice and have it sent to your customer automatically.

- To do so, you need to go to **Settings >** **Revenue **> **Automatic reminders for overdue invoices** and add a new line by clicking the plus sign.

- Next to "Send" you should choose the option "**On creation of invoice from subscription**".

- You can then specify how it should be sent, and which template should be used.

- Go to the subscription you would like to send the invoices automatically from.

- Go to "**Advanced Options**".

- Set the toggle “Autosend invoice” to “**Yes**”.

- 
Now, the invoices from this subscription will be sent automatically. The invoices are always sent in the night.

Invoices that are sent automatically via subscriptions will also automatically be sent via Peppol if the toggle 'Autosend via Peppol' in the advanced options of the subscription is also enabled. 
*Note that the invoice won't be sent through email in this case. If you want to do this, you'll need to send it manually afterwards.*

*Do you want us to enable the toggle 'Autosend via Peppol' in bulk for all of your existing subscriptions? *[*Let us know.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065)

This toggle will automatically be enabled if:

- 'Autosend invoice' is enabled;

- AND your company entity is registered on Peppol; 

- AND your customer is registered on Peppol.

If this toggle is enabled but your customer isn’t registered on Peppol yet, we’ll automatically send the invoice via email instead.
 

*Notes:*

- When you create multiple subscriptions for the same customer with a same renewal date, the invoices will be merged and only one invoice will be sent. If you'd like to send a separate invoice per subscription, please [reach out to our support team](https://support.teamleader.eu/en/support/tickets/new).

- If you choose to send your invoices automatically but want to choose a start number for the fiscal year, you should first create a fiscal year (go to Settings > Revenue > Fiscal years > +). Otherwise the Teamleader Focus system will create a fiscal year automatically when the first invoice is created after the previous fiscal year is finished. The first invoice of this book year will get the default number '1'. Once invoices have been sent, they cannot be renumbered.
