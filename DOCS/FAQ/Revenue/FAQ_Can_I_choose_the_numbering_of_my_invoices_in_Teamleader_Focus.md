# FAQ: Can I choose the numbering of my invoices in Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

The number of an invoice in Teamleader Focus consists of two parts which are separated by a slash. This form cannot be changed but you have some possibilities regarding the prefix and the suffix.

 

# Fiscal year and renumbering

Once invoices are sent, you can no longer [renumber them.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692655031057-FAQ-What-are-the-possibilities-regarding-document-renumbering) That’s why it’s important to make sure your fiscal year and the invoice numbering is set up correctly before each new financial year starts. Make sure to do this for all your company entities if you have [multiple entities. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus)

! Especially if you use [subscriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691389220881-How-To-Creating-a-subscription-in-Teamleader-Focus) to generate invoices, we strongly recommend you create your own fiscal year upfront so you can choose the numbering of your invoices yourself.

A fiscal year is usually a 12-month accounting period. If it matches the calendar year, Teamleader Focus creates a new one automatically if you don't do anything.

 

# Prefix

By default, the fiscal year is set as the prefix. Therefore, you can alter the prefix of an invoice by setting a different name for your fiscal year:

- Go to **Settings **> **Revenue **> **Fiscal years**

- Click on the pencil next to the fiscal year

- In the pop-up that follows you can adjust the name of the fiscal year.

Be aware that this is still a fixed name, you cannot use a date or the name of a customer. This value will be the same for every invoice of that fiscal year.

- You can also set an alternative fiscal year for credit notes.

 

# Suffix

Regarding the suffix, the first invoice or credit note will automatically start with default number 1. 

You have the possibility though to choose the number of your very first invoice of each fiscal year. This option appears in 'Start number' upon creation of the fiscal year (see above) or when adding the first invoice of that fiscal year. The following invoices will automatically count upwards from this number.

Example: You choose 1001 as your start number. Your invoice will then have the following number “2017/1001”. The next invoice number will then be “2017/1002” and so on.
