4. To add the PO number to your invoices, go to **Settings **>** Document layout** > **Invoices** and add the shortcode $INVOICE_PO_NR$ to your [Word template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692647207057-How-To-Customizing-your-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

Note that you can also add the PO number as a column to your invoice overview by clicking the little cogwheel in the lower right corner.

The PO number is also available for exports to Excel or CSV. On top of that, invoices made from a deal or project will automatically take over the PO number filled in on that deal or project.

 

# Notes

- [Peppol:](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-Enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus) In the UBL of your invoice, the PO number corresponds with the field 'OrderReference'.

- When you've enabled the PO number toggle in Settings, the PO number field will also be displayed when adding or editing a **deal. **Know that the PO number you add in a deal will also be taken over in the PO number field of the invoice when you [convert a deal to an invoice.** **](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692519605905-Getting-started-What-are-the-different-ways-to-create-an-invoice)

- The PO number on a deal will also be transferred to the PO number field of a **project** whenever you decide to [convert your deal to a project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695713796625-How-To-Convert-a-deal-or-quotation-into-a-project)
