# FAQ: Can I merge invoices?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

During longer projects, you may need to invoice a single customer at different occasions. In those cases, it would be nice to be able to send these as a single invoice. Less administration for the customer, less chance of delayed payments for you. Everybody’s a winner!

 

It is not possible to merge two or more existing invoices, but Teamleader Focus has some tricks up its sleeve to invoice in an efficient way. Here is how you go about it.

 

## Invoicing Unbilled Time

In case you want to add elements to the time tracking that have not yet been invoiced, you can choose to ‘Invoice unbilled time’.

- Go to the invoices overview.

- Click on **Invoice unbilled time **in the top right-hand corner.

- A list will appear of all the time tracking that has not yet been invoiced.

- From here, you can proceed to create the invoice. Just set the slider to ‘**yes**’ next to the time trackings you want to invoice and click ‘**preview**’.

- All time trackings, that are not related to a project, of the same customer are grouped together on one invoice - one invoice per customer.

- Once the invoice is created, you will be sent to the invoice page where you can add the extra lines for additional products or services.

- You are now ready to send.

 

## Subscriptions

Invoices of subscriptions will be merged automatically under certain conditions. [Read this article for more information.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691412300049-FAQ-Can-I-combine-invoices-of-different-subscriptions-for-one-customer)
