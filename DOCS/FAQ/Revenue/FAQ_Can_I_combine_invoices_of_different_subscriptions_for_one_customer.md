# FAQ: Can I combine invoices of different subscriptions for one customer?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691427124497)

 

It may occur that a customer has several ongoing subscriptions with your company. In this case, combining these subscriptions into one single invoice may come in handy. This is definitely possible, but only under the condition that all of the following values of the subscriptions correspond completely:

- renewal date

- customer

- attn. - line (contact person)

- department

- layout

- bank account

- prepaid options

- payment terms

- related project

- discounts

- draft/permanent invoice setting

- autosend settings

- direct debit settings

 

*Note in case of subscriptions in [another currency:](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692864101137-How-To-Multi-currency-in-Teamleader-Focus)*
Invoices from subscriptions are grouped in one PDF if the above values correspond **and **if they have the same currency and the same currency exchange rate. 

 

In case all those settings correspond, the invoices will be combined automatically. If you don't want the invoices to be merged, simply send an email to [support](https://support.teamleader.eu/en/support/tickets/new) and our support team will happily deactivate this feature for you.
