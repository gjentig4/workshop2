Subscriptions are used to create recurring invoices so you never forget to send the right invoice to your customer. In Teamleader Focus, there are three different ways to create a subscription:

 

1. From scratch

2. From a deal/quotation

3. From an invoice

## Subscription from scratch

- Navigate to **Revenue **> **Subscriptions** and click on **Add subscription **in the top right-hand corner.

- You'll need to fill in the title, the customer's name, the layout, the bank account and the time frame after which a new invoice should be created. The start date is very important, as it influences the invoice date as well.

- Under "**Advanced options**", you'll have the option to decide on the payment term, the invoice timing and even add a link to a project. You can decide whether the automatically created invoice should be booked right away or if you prefer a draft invoice to be created. For more information on how to automatically send invoices, click [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691492744849-FAQ-How-can-I-send-a-reminder-of-an-invoice-in-Teamleader-Focus). [This article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692319531281-How-To-Direct-debit-in-Teamleader-Focus) will tell you more about how direct debit works in Teamleader Focus.

- Add your articles

- Decide whether you'd like the first invoice to be created right away by enabling the slider at the bottom.![The invoice line items editor in Teamleader Focus showing VAT settings and line item fields.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691404276113)

## Subscription from a deal/quotation

- 
[Create a quotation](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693612763409-FAQ-How-can-I-create-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus), or [create a deal](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691911529617-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-deal) and then a quotation for that deal.

- When adding your articles, go to "**Type**". If you choose the recurring cost type and create an invoice for your quotation, you'll have the option to create a subscription as well![Adding items to a quotation in Teamleader Focus with recurring cost options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691374002321)

- 
**Save **the quotation

- When the quotation has been accepted, [convert it to an invoice](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692519605905-Getting-started-What-are-the-different-ways-to-create-an-invoice) via the quotation detail page, or on your deal page go to 'Follow up on your won deal' > **plus ****icon ****> ****I****nvoice.**

- You get the option to create a subscription, click "**Create now**".![The 'Create invoice from quotation' dialog window in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691370275217)

- A new subscription will be added containing the customer's information and the articles you already filled in. The next steps will be the same as when you create a subscription from scratch.

 

## Subscription from an invoice

- Create an invoice.

- If you'd like to turn it into a recurring one, simply click the **three dots **at the very top of your screen and select "**Create subscription**".

- The created subscription will contain the customer's information and all articles on the invoice. The next steps will be the same as when you create a subscription from scratch. 

 

## Editing a subscription

Once you created your subscription and an invoice has been generated from the subscription, it's not possible anymore to edit the start date or the renewal period of your subscription.

 

 

Happy invoicing!
