# Verifactu

Verifactu is Spain’s invoicing anti-fraud law under Ley 11/2021 and Real Decreto 1007/2023. **Compliance becomes mandatory from 01/01/2027 onwards. **It requires businesses to use certified invoicing software that applies a unique QR code to each invoice, ensuring data can’t be changed or deleted. The goal is to improve transparency and prevent tax fraud.

In Teamleader Focus, the process is as follows:

- Enable Verifactu

- Sign the Verifactu identification document
 

**COMING SOON:**

- Put the shortcode for the QR code on your invoice template

- Book invoices or credit notes for this company entity in Teamleader Focus

- As soon as an invoice or credit note is booked, we send this information to AEAT (The Spanish Tax Administration Agency). 

- AEAT checks the ‘Verifactu status’ and if approved they return a QR code that is generated on your invoice/credit note

- Now you can send your invoice/credit note to your customer
 

# Requirements

Verifactu legislation needs to be followed when:

- You have a company entity in your account with the country 'Spain' **and** if;

- Your company entity ZIP code does **not **start with “01” (Álava), “20” (Gipuzkoa) , “31” (Navarra) or “48” (Bizkaia)

*If your ZIP code is empty we treat your entity as Verifactu required.*
 

Note that even though you as a Spanish entity send invoices to other countries or companies that are not in the ‘Verifactu region’, you still need to comply with the law and the QR code will be generated on your invoice.
 

# Enable Verifactu

Every user with access to Settings can enable Verifactu. 

*Note that if you don’t enable Verifactu when you’re actually obliged to according to your ZIP code, then you won’t be able to book an invoice for this company entity until you enable it.*

Follow these steps to enable Verifactu:

- Go to **Settings > Company information **

- Click on **Enable Verifactu** next to your company entity

## Digital signing of documents in Spain

In Spain, digital signing of documents is mainly done through a **personal digital certificate** (certificado digital), usually issued by the FNMT (Fábrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre). This allows you to sign documents with full legal validity.

Here are the main steps to sign a document in Spain with your personal certificate:

### **1. Check if your certificate is valid**

- You need to have a **personal certificate** installed on your computer (in Windows, macOS, or Linux), usually in your browser or operating system.

- You may also have the certificate stored on your **DNI electrónico** or on a smart card/USB token.

 

### **2. Choose software for signing**

In Spain, the most common tools are:

- 
[**AutoFirma**](https://firmaelectronica.gob.es/ciudadanos/descargas) (free software provided by the Spanish government, works on Windows, Mac, and Linux). With this you can sign local files like PDFs, Word documents, etc.

- Some online portals from government bodies (e.g. Agencia Tributaria, Seguridad Social, DGT) also provide **web-based signing** with AutoFirma or browser plugins.
 

### **3. Digitally sign a document with AutoFirma**

- Install AutoFirma (if you haven’t already) and open it. 

- Select the document you want to sign (e.g. PDF).

- Choose your **personal certificate** (you’ll get a list of the certificates installed on your computer).
![AutoFirma certificate selection dialog for electronic document signing](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/41000676988945)

- AutoFirma creates a new file with your digital signature (usually ending with _signed.pdf or .xsig).
 

After your document is signed, you can upload it to Teamleader Focus (*only PDF upload is allowed). *

Verifactu is now enabled in your account! After enabling Verifactu you won’t be able to adapt your ZIP code or your NIF number anymore.
