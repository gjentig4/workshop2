If you want to prevent anyone from making changes to an invoice or a credit note once it’s booked, you can enable a setting in your account. Read on to find out more about this feature!

 

## How

First of all, only [admins ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin)can enable this feature:

- 
Go to **Settings **> **Revenue**

- 
At the top you find ‘Preferences’

- 
Enable the slider **Booked invoices and credit notes can’t be edited**![Toggle switches for invoice currency conversion and editing booked invoices in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693857351441)

Note that this is an **account setting**: when enabled no user in the account can edit booked invoices/credit notes.
