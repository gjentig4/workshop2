A lot of companies prefer to charge their customers in advance. Luckily, Teamleader Focus makes it easy for you. There are four ways to create advance invoices:

- [Manually](#h_01J35HPMZ8B4BYF3KZ62FDT8P9)

- [Via Quotations](#h_01J35HPMZ8CXFBCAAV3SRYBVST)

- [Via Deals](#h_01J35HPMZ8FXRHMDWSMPH8PF7Z)

- [Via Projects](#h_01JPHJQC57JAJPM05EWWMWJZP6)

 

***Case: a customer buys a product or service of € 10.000 VAT excluded. You agree with your customer that he will pay a 50% advance on signing the quotation.***

 

# Manually 

- 
[Create an invoice](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692519605905-Getting-started-What-are-the-different-ways-to-create-an-invoice) of € 5.000 VAT excluded and send it to your customer.

- Now you have two options for your final invoice

- Create an invoice of € 5.000 VAT excluded without any mention of the advance invoice. You are not obligated to mention the previously made invoice.![Example of a generated invoice document in Teamleader Focus showing line items and totals.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690818492817)

- We invoice the total amount and add a negative line mentioning the advance invoice. The amount needs to be - € 5.000. Teamleader Focus will then subtract this amount from the total amount VAT excluded

- Choose to create an '**Advance invoice' **first

- Now you get the option to invoice the amount based on a percentage or a fixed amount. In this example we choose for a fixed amount of € 5.000![The 'Create invoice from quotation' dialog box showing options for a fixed amount invoice.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690780978193)

- Click “**Save**”

- After finishing our job, we go back to our quotation and choose to invoice again. 

 

# Via Deals

- Navigate to “**Deals **” and choose a deal

- There are now two options: either you create an invoice from the won deal, or you create an invoice from the accepted quotation. It's thus not needed to create a quotation first. 

- No matter which option you choose, the process to create an invoice is the same: click on the **plus icon **next to 'Follow up on your deal' and choose **I****nvoice**.*Note: When you have [multiple quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus), you'll first need to choose which quotation you want to create an invoice from*.

- Choose to create an “**Advance invoice**” first

- Now you get the option to invoice the amount based on a percentage or a fixed amount. In this example we choose for a fixed amount of € 5.000![The 'Create invoice from quotation' dialog box showing options for a fixed amount invoice.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690780978193)

- Click “**Save**”

- 
After finishing our job, we go back to our original deal/quotation and choose to invoice again. In the case of a quotation, Teamleader Focus will automatically show us our quotation items and the previously invoiced amount as well.![The 'Invoice items' section in Teamleader Focus showing line items with an advance invoice deduction.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690781032465)
