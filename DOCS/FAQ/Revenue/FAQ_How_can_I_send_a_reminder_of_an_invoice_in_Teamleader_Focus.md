# FAQ: How can I send a reminder of an invoice in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691491268497)

*E-invoicing is set to become mandatory in all European countries by 2030.*
*For Belgium, e-invoicing already became mandatory on 01/01/2026.** Find out all about e-invoicing and enabling **Peppol ***[*here *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-e-invoicing-and-how-do-I-enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)*or *[*set it up in Teamleader Focus.*](https://focus.teamleader.eu/settings.php#company_information)
 

We've all been there once: you've created and sent your invoice, but your customer simply forgot all about it. In this case, it might be time for a reminder. You can either do so manually or choose the option of an automatic reminder. 

 

# Manual reminder

First of all, you need to have sent the invoice already to your customer, before you can send out a reminder.

- In order to send a manual reminder, simply go to the overdue invoice, where you'll find the button 'Reminder'. The number in brackets indicates if you've already sent out a reminder before.

- Click on the button **Reminder**. Your options will then be the same as when you create an invoice for the first time: you'll have to choose a way of sending your reminder.
*Note: you'll only see the button 'reminder' when the invoice is actually overdue, meaning that the payment term has been exceeded. Otherwise you'll see the 'Send' button again.*

- If you click on **Send via email and InvoiceCloud**, you can choose to type an accompanying text yourself, or select one of the predefined templates through **Settings** >** Revenue **> Email templates for invoices.

- The reminder that you're sending out will be the original invoice bearing a '**Reminder' stamp **at the top. The 'Reminder' stamp will only be applied to an invoice if the payment term has been exceeded.

If your invoice has a payment term of 14 days, and you resend an invoice after 15 days, only then will the “Reminder” stamp be applied.

- If an invoice has a payment term of 0 days, there will be a grace period of 12 hours before the reminder stamp is applied. That means if you made a mistake and need to resend the invoice, the stamp won’t be applied immediately, giving you time to adjust it. Even then, you can always access the original version of the invoice - without stamp - via the invoice history.

- In case you'd like to add collection costs as well, you can read [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691540229137-How-To-Interest-and-late-fees) to find out how.

 

**Note:**

When adding the column 'Latest reminder' to your invoice overview, you'll see how often the invoice has been sent so far:

- Not sent yet: Invoice has not been sent yet.

- X days ago (#1): Invoice has been sent for the first time X days ago.

- X days ago (#2): Invoice has been sent for the second time X days ago.

## [Peppol](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-e-invoicing-and-how-do-I-enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- You can’t send an invoice reminder through Peppol. If your customer did not pay, you can send an email reminder repeating the original invoice was sent via Peppol, and you can include the original invoice as a PDF.

- When sending an invoice via Peppol, the counter (to count the amount of times an invoice has been sent) is not updated instantly, only after successfully finishing the delivery.

 

# Automatic reminder

*(This feature is not available in our *[*G**O package*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)* or our *[*SMART package*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)*)*

 

If you prefer avoiding manual work, you can also set an automatic reminder for invoices.
