As an [admin](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin), you can view the contact forms you created (Personal) and the ones your team members created (All). As a non-admin you'll only be able to see the contact form(s) you created.

 

First of all you'll find a list of all the contact forms you've created. You'll find more information on:

- The title of the form

- The number of responses

- The creator of the form

- Where in Teamleader Focus the data will be sent to

- Edit/share/other options

### Prefill contact form questions

When integrating a contact form in your app, platform or website, you can add data in the URL to prefill some answers of questions and improve the customer experience. [Read all about it here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695956076817-How-To-Prefill-contact-form-and-booking-page-questions).

## Responses

Once you've shared a contact form or embedded it on your website, leads and clients can fill it in and submit their answers. You will receive the answers via email, in your Teamleader Focus CRM and you can find them in the responses on the overview page.

 

Access the responses by clicking on the responses hyperlink, e.g. 2 responses. When you have new submitted responses the past 7 days, an icon will be displayed.![Overview of Contact forms in Teamleader Focus showing responses, creators, and data destinations.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695760026513)

 

Now you will see a page with the 10 latest responses:

### Preview form

If you click on **Preview form, **a pop-up shows with a preview of the questions in your form. From within this pop-up, you have the option to edit the form or copy the link.

 

The logo that's shown on the top of your contact form can be edited if you click on **Change branding **at the bottom of the preview. You're then redirected to your [customisation page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/team/customization/) where you can upload or change your logo.![Preview of a customizable Contact form in Teamleader Focus with fields for name and email.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695760192273)

 

### Duplicate form

If you click on **Duplicate form**, all information from your form will be duplicated to a new one with the name 'Duplicate of X'. You can still edit it of course and save it.

### Delete form

You can also delete your form by clicking on **Delete form.** Note that this action cannot be undone. If you've [embedded the contact form on your website](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695815664401-How-To-Embed-a-contact-form-in-your-website) the form will stop working, so make sure to remove it there.

### (De)activate form

When clicking on the **three ****dots **you'll also see the slider '**Active**'. When a form is active, it can be filled out by your leads (on your website). Deactivate the slider if you e.g. temporarily want to remove a form from your website, or if you want to activate another form.
