![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

When you have your own website, you want your leads or customers to get in touch with you as smoothly as possible. With the contact widget in the Lead capture Booster you can let your visitors schedule a time in your calendar that suits them best, fill in a contact form or direct them to your waiting room.

 

It's not needed to embed an entire booking page, contact form or hyperlink in your text, just create a booking button with your own design, copy the widget and paste it in your website. The whole process is really fast, making sure you can focus on the results: attracting customers. Read all about it here.

# 1. Create a new contact widget

To create a contact widget, go to[ Contact widgets](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/contact-widgets/) in the sidebar. When it's the first time you create a contact widget, you will arrive on the information page. Click on **Get started** to continue.![Onboarding screen for creating contact widgets in the Lead Capture Booster.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695392825489)

 

The creation of a contact widget consists of 4 parts:

- Design your button

- Set the button behaviour

- Link the contact type

- Save the contact widget![Configuration screen for creating a custom contact widget button for a website.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695407891345)

 

## 1.1 Design your button

By default the contact widget will have the standard Lead capture Booster colours and icon and the text Book a meeting. You can edit all the options* to have a more customised button.
** Only if you're on the [Beyond package of the Lead capture Booster](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695070912017-The-Lead-capture-Booster-Basic-vs-Beyond-features) will you be able to change and customize the icon. *

 

You can change both the** Button color and Button** **text color** by filling in a hex color code or by clicking the box and selecting a colour manually.

You can change the **Button text** to a custom text of max 30 characters. 

![A form field for entering button text with a character counter.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695366350993)

Next to colours and text, every contact widget can consist of an **Icon**. You can choose to deactivate the icon, use the default icon or upload a custom icon.
