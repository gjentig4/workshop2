There are multiple ways to add your Lead capture Booster booking page(s) on your website:

- 
[Embed an iframe in your website](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695019511185-How-To-Embed-a-booking-page-into-your-website) to show the entire booking page,

- add a link in your text, so clients can be forwarded to the booking page

- 
**or add the contact widget as a button to your website**!

 

After you have [created one or multiple contact widgets](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695401651985-How-To-Using-the-contact-widget-in-the-Lead-capture-Booster), you can embed them in your website.

# 1. Send the code to your webmaster

If a webmaster manages your website, this step is very easy for you. Once you've created a contact widget and you are on the [Contact widgets page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/contact-widgets/welcome/), you can just click on 'Send to webmaster'. This will open your mail program so you can easily send the code.
