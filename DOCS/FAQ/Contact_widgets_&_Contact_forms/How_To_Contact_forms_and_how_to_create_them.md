## What

A contact form on your website serves as a valuable communication channel, bridging the gap between your business and potential customers. By including a contact form, you eliminate barriers to communication, making it easier for potential customers to engage with your brand.

 

The advantages:

- 
**Efficient lead capturing**: Streamline the process of capturing leads from website visitors, making it quick and hassle-free.

- 
**Centralised ****communication**: All leads from the contact form are stored within your Teamleader Focus account, and there's no scattered information across different channels. Enjoy a centralised hub where you can view, manage, respond to, and nurture leads efficiently. And not only that, having everything in one centralised tool also saves valuable time!

- 
**Easy to use** **form ****builder**: You don't need a designer or technical expertise to customise your web forms.

- 
**More business:** By simplifying the lead capturing process and minimising friction, you can see a boost in conversion rates, translating into more leads and business growth.

 

## How

The principle is very simple:

- First of all, you need to activate the [Lead capture Booster](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster) in Teamleader Focus 

- Then you can create a contact form in a few easy steps

- Optionally, you embed the contact form in your website

- Your leads/customers fill out the contact form on your website

- Their answers will get synced to the contact/company/deal fields of your choice in Teamleader Focus
** **

## Create a contact form

 

In Teamleader Focus, click on **Contact forms** in the navigation menu on the left and click on **Activate for free**, or go to the Lead capture Booster and click on **Contact forms**. Click on **G****et started** if it's your first time creating a form, otherwise choose **Create a form **in the top right-hand corner.

 

### 1. Build your form

The **name** of the form will be prefilled as 'Form 1', but you can always adapt this.

*Notes**: *

- *The name of your form is limited to max. 100 characters.*

- 
*When you change the name of your contact form afterwards, this will impact both the contact form URL and the embedded HTML of your contact form.*

*![The 'Build your form' interface in Teamleader Focus for creating lead capture forms.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695766544017)*

Choose **what you want to do **with each completed form. Once checked, there are a few questions that are required. The answers to these questions will be linked to the corresponding fields of your choice in your Teamleader Focus CRM. 

- 
**Create new contact**

A new contact will be added to your contacts in Teamleader Focus. Optionally, you can select one of the [tags ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690854640529-How-To-Using-tags-in-Teamleader-Focus)here that you defined in your CRM settings. This tag will then be added to the contact, making it possible to easily [segment ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)on the contacts created through this form afterwards.

- The required questions are: first name, last name and email

- When checked, you'll be able to link the custom questions (see below) to contact fields in Teamleader Focus

- 
*Note: *If the contact already exists in your Teamleader Focus account (with the same email address), no new contact will be added but the additional information that was filled out (tags or additional questions) will be added to the 'Background information' field of the existing contact.

- 
**Create new company**

A new company will be added to your companies in Teamleader Focus. Optionally, you can select one of the [tags ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690854640529-How-To-Using-tags-in-Teamleader-Focus)here that you defined in your CRM settings. This tag will then be added to the company, making it possible to easily [segment ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)on the companies created through this form afterwards.

- The required questions are: company name

- When checked, you'll be able to link the custom questions (see below) to company fields in Teamleader Focus

- 
*Notes: *

If the company already exists in your Teamleader Focus account (with the same company name), no new company will be added but the additional information that was filled out (tags or additional questions) will be added to the 'Background information' field of the existing company.

- 
What happens if an existing contact with a linked company fills out a form?
If you've selected to 'create new contact *and *create new company', and the contact is already known and linked to an existing company in Teamleader Focus, then if your customer fills out a *different* company no new company will be created. Instead, the additional information will be added to the background information of the already linked company.

- 
**Create new deal**

A new deal will be added to your deals in Teamleader Focus. The title of your deal in Teamleader Focus will be the title of your form.
*Note: *If you have [multiple deal pipelines in your account,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus) the deal will by default be created in the default pipeline. If you want to, you can define another pipeline for the deals to be created in. See [powerful extensions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695775141649-How-To-Contact-forms-and-how-to-create-them#3.-Powerful-extensions) for more information.

- There are no required questions here

- When checked, you'll be able to link the custom questions (see below) to deals fields in Teamleader Focus

 

Add **additional custom questions **by clicking on + Add question

- Fill out your question, choose the type and choose which field to link the answer to

You can link these questions to your contact, company or deal fields in Teamleader Focus (but the available fields also depend on your package cf. 'Basic vs Beyond functionalities'.)

- You can also link your contact/company/deal custom fields. If they are required, then these questions will be added as form questions by default.

- You can preview the question immediately next to it

- E.g. I want to know the primary address of the company:
![Form for creating a custom question in Teamleader Focus with field mapping to a Deal Amount.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695563110673)

- Save the question. When all your questions are ready, click on **Continue**.

 

**Remarks**

- Make sure you either check 'Create new contact' or 'Create new company' if you want to be able to also create a new deal **and **to link the answers to your questions to Teamleader Focus.
![Form automation settings in Teamleader Focus for creating contacts, companies, or deals.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695751627537)

- If you already linked a question to a Teamleader Focus field within for example the Company category, then you won't be able to link a second question to that same Teamleader Focus field.
**Example**: You've already asked your customer their website in this question:
![Configuration modal for adding a website question to a Teamleader Focus lead capture form.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695688185617)
In the next question, you also want to know what their employee platform is: ![Error message in a form builder stating 'This field is already in use on another question'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695704310289)
You'll receive the message that this field is already in use on another question. You can choose e.g. 'Contact website' instead, or the field 'Company - Background information'.

*Note: The field 'Background information' is an exception to this rule, as this field can be linked to several times.*

 

- If you uncheck an option e.g. disable 'Create new company', then the linked questions will be removed:
![A confirmation dialog for disabling company-related questions in a form or lead capture tool.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695751872529)

 

### 2. Customise your form

You can customise your form by:

- uploading a logo and favicon; 

- setting up a title; 

- setting a body font and size;

- selecting colours for the title, text, page background, form background and button text/background; 

- setting up custom introduction, button and success page text;

- adding a downloadable file or by linking to a page with a downloadable file.

 

Double check everything in the preview by clicking on the maximise icon to enlarge the preview.

### 3. Powerful extensions

The powerful extensions consist of the following parts:

- Teamleader Focus CRM behavior

- Notifications

- Redirecting

- Legal

Teamleader Focus CRM behavior

Determine in this part how form information will be handled in Teamleader Focus. Select a Deal assignee, a Deal pipeline and add prefilled answers to your contact form.

 

#### **Deal assignee and deal pipeline**

If you've selected in the first step that a new deal should be created, then you can select a deal assignee and a deal pipeline here.

- By default, the contact form creator will be selected as deal assignee. You can select a different user here or select 'None'.

- If you have [multiple deal pipelines in your account](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus), then the default deal pipeline will be selected at first. Per contact form however you can specify in which pipeline you want your deal to be created. This way, you can differentiate depending on the target audience of the contact forms.
If you afterwards delete the selected pipeline in Teamleader Focus, or your pipeline gets deleted because your package was downgraded, then this field will have no selected pipeline anymore. New deals will automatically be created in your default pipeline.

 

![Configuration settings for Teamleader Focus CRM behavior when handling form information.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27637105373457)

 

#### **Prefilled answers**

In some cases, you'll want to automatically add information about a contact, company or deal without the client having to fill this information out. In this case, **you can set up prefilled answers**!

 

For example, your company offers multiple services and sends a contact form to possible clients of one specific service e.g. cleaning. In this case, you can add a custom field with the options and create a prefilled answer with Cleaning as the only possible answer:

- Click on **Add a field**

- Select a question type for a contact, company or deal

- Fill in or select the answer

- Click on **Submit**
**![A dialog box to add a prefilled answer for a custom field in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27637023579025)**
 

The end user won't see the prefilled answers when visiting the contact form page. When the end user fills in and submits the form, the answers and the prefilled answers will appear in the contact, company or deal information. 
E.g. Carl Doe needs a cleaning service for his company Great company x

![Contact information widget in Teamleader Focus showing details for a contact named Carl Doe.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27637105377809)

Important:

- Add more questions via the same steps. 

- Remove a prefilled answer by clicking on the X.

- When you save the contact form but made a prefilled answer that is invalid, you will see a warning message. Remove the question and add it again with a valid answer.

Notifications 

Set notifications for yourself, colleagues and customers.
![Notification settings for form completions in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695719293457)

- Notify a team member when a form is completed ([Beyond functionality](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695070912017-The-Lead-capture-Booster-Basic-vs-Beyond-features)): select which user should receive an email notification whenever a form is completed. Uncheck the box if you don't want to be notified.
*Note**: this box will be checked by default and the contact form creator is selected. *

- Allow respondents to get a copy of the completed form: whoever filled out the form can choose to receive a copy of the completed form on the email address they provide. It's not possible to personalise the text of this email, however if you've added [custom email HTML template in the Advanced branding of your team settings,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694963991185-FAQ-Can-I-change-the-layout-of-my-meeting-and-invite-emails) this email will also show that layout.

 

Redirecting

If a respondent filled out a form you have two options:
![Configuration settings for redirecting respondents to a custom URL after form submission.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695704572561)

- Show the success page (cf. 'Customise your form')

- Redirect to a specific URL, e.g. a thank you page or your own website

 

Legal

![Legal settings section for forms with a checkbox to ask respondents to accept terms and conditions.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27757401127569)

Ask respondents to accept terms and conditions: before submitting their answers, respondents will first be asked to accept the terms and conditions.

 

You can also set a *custom privacy policy* for your team. Read more about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694722380433-How-To-Customise-your-meeting-rooms-and-booking-pages).

 

**Save** the contact form and **s****hare your form** or go back to the **Contact forms overview page.**
