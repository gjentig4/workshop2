# How To: Embed a contact form in your website

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695826072081)

After you've created a contact form you might want to embed it in your website. By integrating your contact form into your own website, Wordpress, Webflow or Wix, it's possible to achieve just that.

 

If you've set up a custom logo for your contact form or team, the logo won't show in the embedded form.

## General

After you've created a contact form, basically all you have to do is copy the code from the contact forms page and paste in the code base of your website on the right location.

- Go to the **[Contact forms](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/contact-forms/?scope=personal) **page

- Click on the **share icon**** **and choose** Copy embedded HTML**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695811238545)

- Paste the embedded HTML code in your own website, Wordpress or Webflow. For WIX, you'll only need the link so you'll need to cut this one from the HTML code (cf. below).

 

***Example***:

If you choose 'Copy embedded HTML', then your regular form link (e.g. [https://meeting.teamleader.eu/embed/form/teamname/contactform1/](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/embed/form/teamname/contactform1/)) gets added into an iframe code block .This will look like this:

    style="width: 100%; height: 600px;"    src=" https://meeting.teamleader.eu/embed/form/teamname/contactform1/"    frameborder="0">

 

*Note: *The part after /form/ (=teamname) is the team name, while the last part (=/contactform1) is the editable part of the contact form link (which you can edit in the contact forms).

 

If you want to automatically prefill contact form questions you can add data in the parameter behind the URL as in this example:
[https://meeting.teamleader.eu/embed/form/teamname/contactform1/?questions.id=value](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/embed/form/teamname/contactform1/?questions.id=value)

### Own website

Basically all you have to do is copy the embedded HTML iframe and paste it in the code base of your website on the right location.

### Wordpress

#### **Wordpress.com**

It's not possible to embed a contact form in a [Wordpress.com](//Wordpress.com) website. You can add a hyperlink behind text, to forward your clients to a Contact form page.

#### 
**Wordpress.org**

Once you've created the codeblock with the embedded contact form link (see general), you can now embed it in your Wordpress website.

- Open the page where you want to add the codeblock

- Click on the **Plus** and select **Custom HTML****![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695779877265)**

- Paste the iframe code in the custom HTML block![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695795581841)**note: Depending on your layout, you might want to put the iframe in a paragraph.*

- Test and edit the height so the iframe displays perfectly on your website.

- Publish your website

### WIX

## Embed a contact form in a contact widget 

If you don't want to show an entire contact form on your page but you want to put it behind a button, then you can use the contact widget. Optionally, you can choose if the contact form should open in a pop-up window on your website or in a different tab.

- 
Go to [Contact widgets](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/contact-widgets/)

- Click on **Create a widget**

- Design your button

- Select whether the contact form should open in a new tab or on the same page

- 
In 'Link contact type' select Contact form and choose which contact form should show.![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695826634001)

- Hit **Save **and [embed the contact widget in your website](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695420502545-How-To-Embed-the-contact-widget-in-your-website).
