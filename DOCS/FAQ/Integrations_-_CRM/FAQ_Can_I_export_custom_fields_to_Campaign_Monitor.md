# FAQ: Can I export custom fields to Campaign Monitor?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691640152081)

 

 

In [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690737500305-How-To-Sending-email-campaign-with-Campaign-Monitor-in-Teamleader-Focus), you can find general information on how to set up the connection between Teamleader Focus and Campaign Monitor. Here you will find out how you can, next to the standard fields, sync specific custom fields in order to use them in your Campaign Monitor account.

 

Note:

By default, Teamleader Focus will export up to 20 fields (both custom and non-custom) to Campaign Monitor. If the desired custom field is not among those fields, they can be added afterwards. Don't worry about which type of custom field you add: any type can be added to Campaign Monitor.

- Go to your Campaign Monitor settings.

- Add a text field.

- Fill in the name. This name needs to match entirely with the custom field you want to sync from Teamleader Focus (upper/lower case, spaces, etc.)

- Go to "CRM" in Teamleader Focus and click on the **synchronisation icon** in the top black bar (two arrows).

- From now on, the value of the custom field will be filled into the field in Campaign Monitor

**Note:** If you add one of these tags, the fields will not automatically be synchronized/filled in for all contacts/companies. The easiest way to force this to happen is to create a segment which contains contacts or companies (e.g. email is filled in) and sync that segment to Campaign Monitor.
