# FAQ: How can I export my Teamleader Focus contacts to Outlook?

If you have activated the [Microsoft Exchange/Office 365 integration](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690974588305-How-To-Integrate-Microsoft-Exchange-or-Office-365-with-Teamleader-Focus), you also have the possibility to export your Teamleader Focus contacts to Outlook. To do this, click on your user icon on the right hand side and go to **Integrations/Marketplace**. Look for ‘Exchange Calendar’ in the list and click on **Settings**. There you will have the option to enable ‘Contacts’ and choose to export all your contacts or only specific [segments](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus) on contact level.

 

It is important to know that this function is only available for users that have [‘Excel export’ rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691580510609-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-see-the-export-button) enabled. In addition, the Teamleader Focus contact must have the first and last name completed, as well as **one** of the following list: phone, mobile or email.

 

The information that will be synchronized to Outlook, is the following:

- first name

- last name

- email address

- telephone

- mobile phone

- fax

- address of the contact

- linked companies (company name + function)

- phone number and address of the first linked company

 

**Note:** the synchronisation is done every hour and cannot be initiated manually.
