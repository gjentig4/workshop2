When adding a contact or a company you want to of course link all kinds of relevant information to this contact/company page. The 'Files' are your solution to assemble all this information and documents.

In this article we'll give you more info about the following topics related to file management:

- [Add a file](#Add-a-file)

- [Add a folder](#Add-a-folder)

- [Integrations](#Integrations)

- [Delete a file](#Delete-a-file)

- [Delete folders](#Delete-folders)

 

## Add a file

To add a file to a specific item (Companies, Contacts, Projects, Invoices, Tickets, Products, Meetings), just click on the** files tab** at the bottom right-hand corner of the page:

You'll have two options to add a file: 

- You can click on **+ **next to 'Documents' and select the file you want to upload

- You can drag the file into the Files tab. 

 

If you want to add a file to a deal, just click on the **+** next to 'Files' or drag and drop your file in the 'Files' field.

## Integrations

If you often manage large files and you don’t only want to keep them in Teamleader Focus, then our Dropbox integration will definitely suit your needs! Read more about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692160411409-How-To-How-do-I-link-Dropbox-to-Teamleader-Focus).

 

## Delete a file

You can easily delete a file by clicking on the** Files tab **and hovering over the file that you want to delete > right-click > **D****elete file**:

On your deal detail or quotation detail page, you can delete a file by clicking on the **three dots** next to the file > **Delete file**

Notes:

- Files deleted in Teamleader Focus will also be deleted in file management integrations 

- Files deleted in file management integrations won't be deleted in Teamleader Focus.

 

- However, when there are more than 10 files added to a Files tab, you'll need to click on the **Folder icon **to access all files.
 

- ![The Files section in Teamleader Focus showing uploaded PDF documents and action icons.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697959804561)

- Navigate to the file you'd like to delete, open the preview and then click on the **bin **to delete the file. If you want to delete a file that isn't a .pdf though (no preview can be generated), this workaround is not possible. Please [contact our support team](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065) in this case.

 

## Delete folders

To delete an entire folder, you'll first have to delete all files that are linked to it. Once the last linked file has been deleted, Teamleader Focus will automatically delete the folder.
