# FAQ: Can I receive incoming VoIP calls on my mobile phone?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692160626449)

You cannot receive incoming VoIP calls directly on your mobile phone, but there is an easy workaround: you can pass the incoming VoIP calls on to your mobile phone. 

To do so, go to **Integrations/Marketplace **> **VoIP **and adjust the settings. Choose** '****Call forwarding'** instead of **'Voicemail' **and fill in the mobile number you'd like to forward calls to.
