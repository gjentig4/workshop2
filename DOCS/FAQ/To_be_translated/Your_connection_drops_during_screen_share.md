# Your connection drops during screen share?

Sharing your screen in a Vectera meeting room is very useful.  A lot of devices and monitors have a very comfortable resolution with many, many pixels. Especially larger screens (24" and higher) allow you to view applications with a lot of detail.

**Sharing an application, tab or your whole desktop can in this case result in a connection drop.** All of the pixels on your screen are streamed to your meeting participants, requiring much bandwidth. Not every internet connection allows this increase in bandwidth-demand.

### So how do you share something on a screen with a high resolution?

**Try sharing a smaller part of that screen by resizing the program you're sharing to smaller dimensions.** Choose to share "app window" or "browser tab" and make sure those are not visually maximised on your screen or monitor.
