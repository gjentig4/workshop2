# FAQ: How do I change my camera/microphone/speaker in the meeting room?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694114011793)

The meeting room will auto-select a camera, microphone and speaker. If you use an external camera, microphone or speaker (Chrome only), it will normally select this one.

# How do you change your microphone, speaker or camera?

Click on **Settings **at the bottom of the screen.

On the left side, you will see audio/video and be able to change the settings.
After you have changed it you can always test if the new microphone/speaker works by clicking on 'test your mic/speaker':

- **Test your mic**: you can speak and afterwards listen if the microphone picks up the sound. The bars will indicate how loud your voice/noise is.

- **Test your speaker**: you will hear the 'guest wants to enter' tune. (only available in Chrome).

- **Camera**: your camera will start. Make sure your 'video and screen share quality' (below the camera setting) isn't set on audio only!

# Improve and lower video quality

If you notice that there's a good connection between you and the customers, as a host you can change the video quality in the meeting room settings from standard to HD. **Activate the slider HD Video Quality**. This setting is only available for the meeting host and will apply to all participants.

If you or the customer notices a very bad connection it's a good idea to block the video streams. Therefore you can Disable incoming video streams in the meeting rooms settings. **Activate the slider Disable incoming video**. This setting is available for all meeting participants and will only apply to whom has activated it.
