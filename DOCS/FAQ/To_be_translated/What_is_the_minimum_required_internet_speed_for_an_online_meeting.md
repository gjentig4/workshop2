# What is the minimum required internet speed for an online meeting?

The connections in meeting rooms between participants are peer to peer connections. We use WebRTC to make this possible. This means that when more people enter the meeting room, every participants' internet connection needs to be stronger.

This technology is superior for one-on-one meetings and meetings in small groups, but requires a decent internet connection with minimal latency for a smooth online meeting with larger groups.

In general: the higher your internet speeds, the better quality of video and audio you will receive.

# Required internet speed

Every stream requires 1 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload. 1 Stream is for example sharing one camera or sharing one screen.

For a good one-on-one meeting with camera and microphone you would need at least **2Mbps download, 2Mbps upload and a max ping of 25.** (Ping = delay).

In general, downstream capacity is not the limiting factor. It's rather the upstream capacity. For example: If you have a connection of 100Mbps download and 1Mbps upload, there's a chance the other participants might notice small interruptions in the connection.

# How to test your internet speed?

It's really easy to find a website that can test your internet speed. You can google 'internet speed test' and you will find several options.

You can use [https://www.speedtest.net/](https://www.speedtest.net/) to check how strong our internet connection is.

# Speedtest explained

Internet speed refers to the speed which data and content travels from the World Wide Web to your device. It is usually measured in megabits per second (Mbps)

Download speed is the rate in which data is transferred from 'the internet' to your computer, while upload speed is the rate in which data is transferred from your computer to 'the internet'.  Ping shows the latency of the connection and should be as low as possible.

The internet connection in the example above is good. Online meetings with such internet speeds should be high quality and stable.

# Test your connection in a real life situation

Connection test results vary greatly depending on the changes in your real-life situation. The above mentioned Speedtests are snapshots, which can vary during the course of the day. If someone else in your house starts another meeting, a gaming session or a Netflix session, Speedtest results will vary. Try to perform the test multiple times, at moments when the internet connection is stressed.

You can check the real time connection indicator in meeting rooms to check your connection quality. If bars become red, your connection is too weak for a decent conversation.
