# FAQ: Why does my camera/microphone not work?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694772919953)

If you are reading this article you probably had the message that the Customer Meeting add-on can't find a camera or microphone or that the camera/microphone doesn't work.

You might get one of these notifications from the Customer Meeting add-on in a meeting room.

There are several possibilities why your microphone or camera doesn't work or can't be found. We will list them here!

# First step

Restart your device (turn it off and on) and launch the browser where you've had the notification that your device can't be found. If the message still shows, continue to read this article. If it doesn't, you're good to go!

# Meeting room settings 

Before we have a look into the more technical settings, it might be good to check whether the meeting room has selected the correct camera/microphone.*** ***[You can read here how to change this.](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25694069482385)

# Browser settings

If changes in the meeting room settings didn't solve the problem, you might want to check your browser settings.

# Extensions and ad blockers

Installing browser extensions or add-ons is often very handy. But they can impact your meeting experience with the Customer Meeting add-on. Add blockers can also block the technology Vectera runs on to work smoothly.
