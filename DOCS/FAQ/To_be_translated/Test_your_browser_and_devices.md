# Test your browser and devices

Vectera is proud to be device agnostic. This means Vectera works on any device, without installations. But you're about to have your first meeting. Or have some new hardware to show off like that brand new headset. **So you want to make sure everything works as fine as you would expect. **That's why we integrated thorough testing on different moments in your meeting journey.

1. Before your first meeting, visit [vectera.com/test](https://www.vectera.com/test/) and choose the devices with which you want to communicate.

2. Right before joining a meeting, you can select to join with audio + video, audio only or without audio / video.

- When joining with audio and video, you will see your camera activated and an audio indicator. Try to speak to see if it's moving!

- If you chose Audio Only, you will only see the audio indicator.

- Click on the arrow for your microphone, speaker (Chrome only!) and/or camera to select another device. Vectera will remember the devices you chose for your next meetings!

- You're all set now. Click "Join" to join the meeting!

3. During the meeting, you can revisit the settings from 2. by clicking on Settings at the bottom of the meeting room:
