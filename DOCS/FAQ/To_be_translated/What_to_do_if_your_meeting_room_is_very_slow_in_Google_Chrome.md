# What to do if your meeting room is very slow in Google Chrome?

If your meeting room is responding very slow and video is not going smooth, it might be due to a bad internet connection or a very high CPU usage. But one Google Chrome setting can improve this: Hardware acceleration!

The hardware acceleration setting makes Chrome load faster by offloading some of the processes to the GPU. This is how you can check and activate it:

- 
Open Google Chrome and go to settings

- 
Activate 'Use hardware acceleration when available'

4. Restart your browser and check if your meeting room is running faster and smoother.
