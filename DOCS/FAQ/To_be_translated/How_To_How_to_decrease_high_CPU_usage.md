# How To: How to decrease high CPU usage

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694250633873)

A high CPU usage, sometimes going hand in hand with a heating device, is usually a result of your device giving its fullest.

There are a lot of processes in your device that require a lot of processing power, sometimes causing your device to heat up. This is not necessarily a bad thing - most devices are very well suited to cope with those circumstances.

### What can you do to avoid high CPU usage when using the Customer Meeting add-on?

- Check whether it's the Customer Meeting add-on ramping up your CPU usage, or if there are **other intensive processes running** (in the background). Installing updates, syncing a lot of files with a cloud storage provider, ... Try pausing these processes when you're about to have long or a lot of meetings.

- Sharing your screen in the Customer Meeting add-on is very useful. A lot of devices have a very comfortable resolution with many, many pixels. (Nearly) all these pixels need to be streamed to your participants, requiring your CPU to give its best.**If you're sharing something on a screen that has a high resolution, try sharing a smaller part of that screen** by resizing the program you're sharing to smaller dimensions. **Choose to share "app window" or "browser tab"** and make sure those are not visually maximised on your screen or monitor.

- The Customer Meeting add-on allows you to share multiple screens. Although you can only maximise one screen with the other screens minimised, each additional screen takes up some of your CPU power. **Try limiting the amount of shared screens**. Each additional screen also requires more bandwidth, so also make sure you have a good connection!
