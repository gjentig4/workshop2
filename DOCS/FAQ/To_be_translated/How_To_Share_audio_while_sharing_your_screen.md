# How To: Share audio while sharing your screen

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695154413713)

In online meetings with customers or colleagues, it's very convenient to share a full screen, application or tab with the other participants. But if you share a page that shows a video (eg. Youtube), how can you share the audio as well?

There are 2 possibilities: Browser tab or Full screen.

## **Share a browser tab with audio**

In the Customer Meeting add-on it's possible to share a browser tab to show a video with audio. This is how you do it:

- Open the meeting room in Google Chrome, Edge or opera and open the other tab (with the video) that you want to share.

- Make sure to[ install the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vectera-helper/nllnakkoanoloffpgpglbkijkdmiohmi?hl=en) in your Chrome browser.

- Click share screen and choose for browser tab.

- Now you will see a pop-up where you can select the tab that you want to share. Click on that tab.

- At the bottom of the pop-up screen you will see a checkbox that says 'share audio'. Make sure this is active before you click on share!

- When the tab is selected and the checkbox share audio is active, you can click on share. Now the other participants should be able to see and hear the content you are sharing.

## **Share a full screen with audio**

It's also possible to share a full screen with audio, so you can open a video in a browser or on your computer and share the audio.

This is currently (March 2022)** possible in Google Chrome on devices with Windows as the operating system when the Customer Meeting add-on helper extension is disabled**.

- Open the meeting room in Google Chrome on a windows (OS) device and open the other tab (with the video) or the video/audio file that you want to share.

- Deactivate the Customer Meeting add-on Helper extension in chrome://extensions/

- Click share screen and choose for Entire screen.

- Now you will see a pop-up where you can select the screen that you want to share. Click on that screen.

- At the bottom of the pop-up screen, you will see a checkbox that says 'share system audio'. Make sure this is active before you click on share!

- When the screen is selected and the checkbox share system audio is active, you can click on share. Now the other participants should be able to see and hear the content you are sharing.
