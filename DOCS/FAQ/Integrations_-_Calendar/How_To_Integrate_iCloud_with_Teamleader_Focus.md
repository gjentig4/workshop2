# How To: Integrate iCloud with Teamleader Focus

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690959197073)

 

We don’t leave Apple users out in the cold either. The third agenda link is to iCloud, Apple’s agenda service. If you want to integrate your iCloud Calendar with Teamleader Focus, follow these steps:

 

1. Go to your **user icon **in the top right-hand corner and click on **Integrations/Marketplace**. Search for ‘Apple iCloud Calendar’.

 

2. Once you have selected this integration, click on **ADD **and **authorize **to grant the requested access.

 

3. You will be asked to enter your Apple iCloud username and password. Since Apple activated the two-factor authentication as an extra layer of security, you will need to create an application-specific password and use this to activate the integration with Teamleader Focus.

Follow these steps to create an app-specific password:

- Go to [https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin](https://account.apple.com/#!&page=signin)

- Log in with your apple ID

- At 'Sign-in and security' you will see 'App-Specific Passwords'. Click on it and click on the '+' to generate a new password. 

- Copy the app-specific password and paste it your integration settings.
 

4. Click on **test credentials** to make the connection. Once it is successful, you will be able to select:

- one agenda to which you want to synchronize the meetings from Teamleader Focus

- multiple agendas from which you want to import calendar items

- to push tasks and calls from your Teamleader Focus planning to your personal agenda

Remarks

- Items which are fetched from your iCloud agenda appear as [grey blocks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691415928721-FAQ-Why-do-I-only-see-grey-blocks-in-the-agenda-of-my-colleague) in your Teamleader Focus agenda so that colleagues cannot see your personal meetings. You can convert these to visible meetings by right-clicking on them in your Teamleader Focus agenda.

- Because the link works in both directions, adjustments in your Teamleader Focus or iCloud agenda will always be synchronized. The synchronization runs in the background every half an hour. However, for good measure, we recommend you start the sync manually when it is the first time you make the connection. You can do this by going to Agenda and clicking on the synchronisation symbol  ![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690932443793)on the right.

- There's also the possibility to limit access to a user's calendar. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691555792401-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-see-the-calendar-of-my-colleagues).

- In the [Lead capture Booster,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster) you can integrate your iCloud calendar as well and let customers schedule meetings directly into your calendar. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695106112785-How-To-Scheduling-in-the-Lead-capture-Booster).

- Calendar events from your external calendar will only be synced to Teamleader Focus starting from the date you set up your calendar integration. Historical/past data is not synced e.g. meetings from last month.

- Calendar events from your external calendar that span multiple days or are recurring events cannot be converted to meetings or tasks.
