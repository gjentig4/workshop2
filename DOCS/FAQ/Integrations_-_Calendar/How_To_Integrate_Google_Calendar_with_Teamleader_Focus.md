![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)

 

If you want to integrate your Google Calendar with Teamleader Focus, you can follow the steps in this article.

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

![Tutorial banner for integrating Google Calendar into Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690971367953)

 

1. Go to your **user icon** on the right-hand corner > click on **Integrations/Marketplace **in order to arrive at the Marketplace. Now search for ‘Google Calendar’.

 

2. Once you have selected this integration, click on **ADD **and **authorize **to grant the requested access. 

 

3. You will immediately be asked to log in with your Google account. Next, grant access to the services which are required, such as your agenda, email address and contacts. You don’t have to do anything else to establish the link with Google.

 

For Google Workspace users:

When encountering the following error message: **Error 400: admin_policy_enforced **, please follow these steps to solve this: 

- Go to your Google workspace admin page > Security > API-rights. 

- You will see Teamleader Focus as installed app 

- Click on the three dots on the right side so it can be added to the list of trusted integrations. 

- You can find more information [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en).

 

4. You will now be redirected to the Marketplace, where you can change the settings for the integration. You have the option to enable the synchronisation with your Google Agenda or [Contacts](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690849276689-How-To-Syncing-contacts-from-Teamleader-Focus-to-Google-Contacts).

 

If you enable the agenda synchronisation, you can select:

- one agenda to which you want to synchronise the meetings from Teamleader Focus

- multiple agendas from which you want to import calendar items

- to push tasks and calls from your Teamleader Focus agenda to your personal agenda

- to push Google Resources to [manage your meeting rooms](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692282505873-FAQ-How-can-I-manage-common-locations-in-Teamleader-Focus)

Remarks

- Items which are fetched from your Google Calendar appear as [grey blocks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691415928721-FAQ-Why-do-I-only-see-grey-blocks-in-the-agenda-of-my-colleague) in your Teamleader Focus agenda so that colleagues cannot see your personal meetings. You can convert these to visible meetings by clicking on them in your Teamleader Focus calendar.

- Because the link works in both directions, adjustments in your Teamleader Focus or Google Calendar will always be synchronized. The synchronisation runs in the background every 2 hours. However, for good measure, we recommend you start the sync manually when it is the first time you make the connection. You can do this by going to **Agenda**** **and clicking on the synchronisation symbol ![Grey sync or recurring icon with two arrows in a circular loop.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690932443793) on the right.

- Google Workspace users: you might have received an email with the following message: *"Starting February 15, 2021, Google Workspace accounts will only allow access to apps using OAuth. Password-based access will no longer be supported." *
But don't worry, our Google calendar integration already exclusively uses OAuth, so this change has no impact on your integration.

- There's also the possibility to limit access to a user's calendar. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691555792401-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-see-the-calendar-of-my-colleagues).

- In the [Lead capture Booster](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster), you can integrate your Google calendar as well and let customers schedule meetings directly into your calendar. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694293021969-How-To-Connect-your-Google-Calendar-with-the-Lead-capture-Booster).

- Calendar events from your external calendar will only be synced to Teamleader Focus starting from the date you set up your calendar integration. Historical/past data is not synced e.g. meetings from last month.

- Calendar events from your external calendar that span multiple days or are recurring events cannot be converted to meetings or tasks.
