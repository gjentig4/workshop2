As you might know, you can link your Teamleader Focus calendar to your external calendar ([Google Calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690925270033-How-To-Integrate-Google-Calendar-with-Teamleader-Focus), [Outlook Calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690974588305-How-To-Integrate-Microsoft-Exchange-or-Office-365-with-Teamleader-Focus) or [iCloud Calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690933196689-How-To-Integrate-iCloud-with-Teamleader-Focus)) thanks to our calendar integrations. In this article you’ll find out how to activate notifications for calendar items on your smartphone. This way, you can receive reminders for upcoming meetings, tasks or calls. The steps for Android as well as iOS will be discussed.

 

# Google Calendar

The notifications work on all levels: meetings, tasks and calls. To receive these reminders, follow these steps:

- Create a meeting in Teamleader Focus ![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693074448657) 

- Click on the arrows in the top right corner to synchronize these items manually to Google Calendar, or wait for the automatic synchronization. ![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693043698065)

- When the Teamleader Focus calendar items are synced to Google Calendar, you can define some settings here to choose when to receive a reminder for these items on your phone. For Android, [follow the steps described in this article](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37242?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1).

# Outlook Calendar

If you have the Outlook Calendar app on your phone, you’ll receive the same notifications.
