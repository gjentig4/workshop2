![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697849286161)

Depending on your type of business, you might want to invoice your travel distance to your customer. In this article you will find out how to set your cost per kilometer and how to invoice these kilometers to your customer.

 

*Make sure you enable travel distance in your account to have cost per km automatically calculated. Read *[*this article*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697848966545-How-To-Travel-distance-in-Teamleader-Focus)* for more information. *

 

## Set your cost per kilometer

The cost per kilometer can be set by going to **Settings **> **Time Tracking > Change cost per kilometer**.

 

## Where can you use the cost per kilometer?

You can use the cost per kilometer on two different levels in Teamleader Focus; via meetings and via work orders.

 

### Meetings

- Create a meeting, [add your departure address](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692040007313-FAQ-How-can-I-edit-the-departure-address-of-a-meeting) and your meeting address

- When your meeting is done, make sure you finish it by clicking on **Mark as done**

- Now you can add a time tracking for your meeting. Make sure the toggle ‘Billable’ is enabled.

Underneath ‘Duration’ you will also find the traveled distance. If necessary you can change the amount of kilometers or recalculate it in Google Maps by clicking on **Calculate…**
 

- Now you have two options to invoice the distance:

Go to the customer page > Unbilled time spent > **Actions **> **Create ****invoice**.
On the invoice page, you will find the travel cost as ‘Mileage allowance’.

- Go to **Revenue** > **Invoices **> **Invoice ****unbilled ****time **> search for the **customer**, activate the **toggle **next to 'Unbilled time' and click on **preview **in the bottom right-hand corner > Activate the **toggle **next to 'Confirm action' > **Do ****now **> Click on the draft invoice. On the invoice page, you will find the travel cost as 'Mileage allowance'.
 

### Work orders

- When you create a work order, you can also add your travel distance.

- It might be that you created the work order linked to a project and that you want to invoice the work order, travel distance included, from your project and not as separate time tracking.
