# FAQ: Why can't I execute bulk actions on tasks and calls?

Bulk actions on tasks and calls can only be executed by a user with administrator rights.

E.g. an admin can delete tasks in bulk via **Calendar** > **Tasks** > create or select a segment > **Actions** > **Delete > Do now.** Note that this can only be done for tasks without time tracking.
