Whenever you finish a call, you need to fill in a call outcome to make sure you're on top of your calls and keep track of status of your calls.

By default, Teamleader Focus automatically suggests standard outcomes, such as "successful call", "no interest", "voicemail" and "other". But you also have the option to define additional call outcomes specific to your business. For each of those outcomes, you can then define appropriate follow-up actions.

- To get started, simply navigate to **Settings** > **Calendar **> **Call outcomes** > click on the **+** symbol. 

- On the following screen, you'll need to define certain parameters.

Name: The name of the call outcome as displayed in the list of call outcomes when you finish a call.

 

Type: You can choose between "Incoming", "Outgoing" or "Both". 

 

Follow-up action: You can define a follow-up action to each call outcome. This can be a task, a meeting, a call or a ticket. The last option is only available if you also use shared inbox.

How this follow-up action works? Once you've chosen a call outcome with a specific follow-up action and save this, a pop-up screen for a task, meeting, call or ticket will open automatically.
