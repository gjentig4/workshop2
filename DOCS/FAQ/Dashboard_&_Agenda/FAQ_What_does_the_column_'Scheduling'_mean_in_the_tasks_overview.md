# FAQ: What does the column 'Scheduling' mean in the tasks overview?

Do you have a big to-do list of tasks and you can't see the wood for the trees anymore? No worries, the column 'Scheduling' in the task overview will help you set priorities.

In this column you'll see two different colors depending on the due date of the task:

- 
Bright green: you still have time to finish this task, the due date is in the future

- 
Light green: 

the task hasn't been planned yet

- the due date is passed. The amount of days that have passed by since the due date will be mentioned next to the light green square.
