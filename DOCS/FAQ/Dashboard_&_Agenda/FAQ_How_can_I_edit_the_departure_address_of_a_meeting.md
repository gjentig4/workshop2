# FAQ: How can I edit the departure address of a meeting?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692044911505)

 

Before you can edit the departure address of a meeting you'll need to enable a setting first. Go to **Settings > Calendar > Preferences > Show distances to meetings** and **enable** the toggle.

- Go to the meeting in question > Click on the **pencil** next to the estimated travel time. *Do note that you can only edit departure addresses of meetings, you are actually attending.*

- Fill in the starting location for this meeting, e.g. your home address or the location of another meeting

- You have the option to set this address as default address by putting the toggle next to "Make default meeting location" to "**Yes"**

- Click "**Save**"

 

But what if I leave from Brussels every morning and my colleague leaves from Ghent?

Setting the departure address of a meeting is a **personal setting **and not an account setting. This means that every Teamleader Focus user needs to go through the settings above individually to set his/her own departure address.
