![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

There are several possibilities to add meetings in Teamleader Focus:

- Add a meeting via the dashboard

- Add a meeting via the calendar

- Add a meeting via the plus sign

- Add a meeting via a deal

- Add an online meeting via the Lead capture Booster

- Add a meeting via a deal phase

- Add a meeting via a project

** **

## 1. Add a meeting via the dashboard

- The first possibility is to add a meeting straight on your dashboard by clicking the **plus sign**.

- Next you can complete the details of this meeting. Fill out the customer field to link this meeting to a contact/company. As you can see, you have [different locations to choose from](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25692167395857).This choice has an effect on how much you can[ invoice your customer ](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25691017896081)as you can [let Teamleader Focus calculate the travel costs](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25692040007313) and add them automatically to your invoice. 

- Once the meeting is created, you will see you can add colleagues (via the pencil) and external contacts (via the plus sign) to the meeting:![The 'Colleagues attending' and 'Contacts attending' sections for managing event participants.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691944601233)

 

### Send meeting invitations and reminders

When you add external contacts to a meeting, you have the option to send a[ meeting invitation](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25691228260881) and a[ reminder for the meeting](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25691506715921) the day before via text. However, you do need to set up templates for meeting invitations and need to agree internally on whether you want to send a reminder the day before or not.

 

### Add recurring meetings

If you conduct weekly meetings, use the option [to copy a meeting ](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25691881985169)or make a meeting recurring. Select a meeting and click the three dots next to "Meeting info" > **Repeat meeting**.

 

## 2. Add a meeting via the calendar

- Another option is to go to **Calendar** > **Meetings** and clicking on **Add meeting** in the top right-hand corner.

- You can also add a meeting by double-clicking in the calendar and selecting **Add meeting**. 

 

## 3. Add a meeting via the plus sign

- Or click on the plus sign in the top right hand corner and select ‘**add meeting**’.

- Teamleader Focus will automatically complete the meeting with information depending on where you are when you click the plus sign. For example, if you open a contact in the CRM section and then click this plus sign, this contact person will automatically be filled out as the 'Customer' of the meeting.

 

## 4. Add a meeting via a deal

On your [deal page](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25697814636305) you can find the section 'Scheduled actions'. Click on the button **Meeting**** **to add a meeting and it will be automatically linked to your deal.

 

## 5. Add an online meeting via the Lead capture Booster

After you’ve activated the [Lead capture Booster](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25694859794577) in your account, you can go ahead and start creating your online meetings. [Read this article to learn how.](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25695076147601)

 

 

## 6. Add a meeting via a deal phase

- You can trigger follow-up actions when moving a deal from one phase to another. Read more about it [here](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25697662084497). A follow-up action could be a follow-up meeting for example.

- When moving from one phase to another, a pop up window opens automatically with the customer details already filled in.

- You can link the meeting to the deal here. 

 

## 7. Add a meeting [via a project](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25695560896145)

- Go to the project in question and navigate to the Work breakdown of this project.
