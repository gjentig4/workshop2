# FAQ: Can I add extra work types?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

Your Teamleader Focus account has some default work types, but you can always add your own custom work types. Read all about it in this article.

 

First of all, custom work types can be added under **Settings **> **Calendar > Work types > +.**

**![The 'Add Work type' dialog box in Teamleader Focus for creating new billable activities.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691908021905)**

- Start with assigning a name to your work type.

- Assign an external price per hour to your work type
*! This feature is not available in our *[*GO*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)* package, as you need the *[*time tracking functionality*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)* to be able to invoice work types.*

- When you click on **Show advanced options**, you can assign a colour to your work type. This will be the colour that'll be displayed in your calendar when you schedule a task with this work type.
! If you also use our [Planning module,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696175894929-How-To-Planning-in-Teamleader-Focus) you can enable a setting via your Planning preferences that allows you to display the different colours of your work types in your planning too.

 

*Note:* Keep in mind that the work types you created in settings can be selected when creating or editing tasks but not for calls or meetings.

 

## Default work type when adding new task

In our [GO ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)package, the default work type that's displayed when creating a new task, will be the first work type (listed alphabetically) in your list.

 

In all our other packages, the default work type that's displayed when creating a new task depends on the last work type you time tracked in Teamleader Focus. The work type you last tracked time on will automatically be suggested when you create a new task.
