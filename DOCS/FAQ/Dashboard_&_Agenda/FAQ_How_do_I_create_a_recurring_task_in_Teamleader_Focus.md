In [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691951764497-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-task-in-Teamleader-Focus), you'll find general information on how to create a task in Teamleader Focus. This can be done through several ways. In some cases, you may want to create a recurring task, e.g. checking mails every Monday morning.

 

1. Add a task and fill in the needed information.

 

2. Enable the toggle next to "Repeat..."

3. Afterwards, you set the occurrences, e.g. daily or weekly. You can also define the time frame and the end date.

 

4. You then click on "**Save and schedule**" to schedule those recurring tasks in your calendar.

 

Important note: [Unassigned tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697667516817-How-To-Unassigned-tasks-in-Teamleader-Focus) can't be repeated. This because recurring tasks are immediately planned in the agenda and we can't do this without an assignee. First assign this task to a colleague to make it recurring.
