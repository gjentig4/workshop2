# FAQ: What do the colors in my Teamleader Focus calendar stand for?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691071424145)

 

Always wondered what the meaning of the colors in your Teamleader Focus calendar is? Simple:

- Green: a task

- Blue: a meeting

- Grey: a personal meeting. The content can’t be seen by your colleagues

- Light blue: a call

- Orange: you will see this color in the team view, and it means that the user has a leave. In the daily/weekly view, it will be shown in grey

- Any other color: your company can choose to assign a special color to a specific work type. This means this only applies to tasks and not to calls and meetings:

Navigate to “**Settings**” and click on “**Calendar**”

- Click on the “**+**” symbol next to “Work types”

- Give your new work type a name

- Click on “**Advanced options**” and choose a color![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691060527377)

- 
**Save** your new work type.
