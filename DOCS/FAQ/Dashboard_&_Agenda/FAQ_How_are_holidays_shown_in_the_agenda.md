In Teamleader Focus, you can also manage days off. Once your holidays have been[ asked](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690726245905-How-To-Requesting-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus) and[ approved](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691095003153-How-To-Approving-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus), they will be shown in the calendar. 

 

Your holidays will be displayed in your calendar according to the view:

 

- In the **day view**, a message will inform you that you are off that day or if it's a company closing day:
