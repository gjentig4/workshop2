# How To: Use Teamleader Focus for prospecting or as a call center

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693656750353)

 

Do you have to do a lot of daily calls to phone up leads? If you’re using Teamleader Focus as a tool for prospecting or as a call center, you can find some useful tips in this article.

## Create a call list

First of all, you need to create a call list with calls that will be assigned to your user. To do this, follow these steps:

- Go to **Contacts**/**Companies**

- Create a [segment ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)of the customers you want to actively call/follow up or activate. Create a segment based on characteristics they share, like ‘Last activity is previous month’.

- Select the **segment **you created

- Click on **Actions **in the top right-hand corner 

- Choose [**Create calls**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692017785361-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-execute-bulk-actions-on-tasks-and-calls)

- Fill out the start date of your calls, their duration and the assignee. An average of your calls per day will be calculated and a calculation of the working days you need will be shown.

- 
**Confirm **the action and click on **Do ****now**
*Important: this bulk action cannot be undone!*

## Perform your calls

After you’ve created your calls, it’s time to perform them. Working through your list efficiently has a lot of benefits:

- You don't have to click through everything and can work from one environment very fast. 

- You lose less time keeping track of who you called already or still have to call. 

- By using this list you can easily keep track of your targets [through your insights.](https://focus.teamleader.eu/stats_calls.php)

 

View the calls in your to do’s of today [on your dashboard](https://focus.teamleader.eu/dashboard.php), or look at them by going to **Calendar **> **Calls **> filter on your name.

- Go through your calls one by one and **Mark them as done**

- Choose a call outcome and write a summary of the call

- The call will be logged in the activities of your contacts/companies

- You can define a follow-up action to each call outcome ([read more about call outcomes here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691879792273-How-To-Adding-call-outcomes)). If you reached your contact’s voicemail for example, choose the call outcome ‘Voicemail’ and define a follow-up action “call” for this outcome. A follow-up call will be created then to remind you to call back.
