# FAQ: How can I see which tasks I have created for my colleagues?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691612549521)

 

To create an overview of the tasks you created for colleagues, you can follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Agenda** > **Tasks** and click on the dropdown menu next to the search field to select **Create new segment**. 

- Give the segment a name, such as “Tasks created by me” for example.

- Define the rules as shown in the screenshot below and click **save** to create an overview of all the tasks you created but assigned to someone else.

- Also team tasks and [unassigned tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697667516817-How-To-Unassigned-tasks-in-Teamleader-Focus) will appear in this overview, and not only the ones assigned to one specific person.
