# FAQ: Can I copy a meeting?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691884577553)

It is indeed possible to copy a meeting, just follow the steps below.

- Navigate to the meeting you would like to copy > Click on the **three dots **next to "Meeting info"

- Click on "**Copy meeting**"

- A popup appears where you can fill in the new date, new time and new duration. Those changes only affect the newly created meeting, not the original one.

- The attending colleagues will be added automatically to the new meeting and will receive a notification. In case also external contacts were added, you will get the option to add those to the new meeting, as well as the option to send them a new invitation.

- Click on "**Copy**" and the new meeting is created.
