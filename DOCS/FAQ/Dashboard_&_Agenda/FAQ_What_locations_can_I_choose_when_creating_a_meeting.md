# FAQ: What locations can I choose when creating a meeting?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692145312913)

 

When creating a meeting, you have several options to choose from:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692139437073)

 

## Location of a company/contact

- Choose the location of a company or a contact. Note that you'll still need to add external contacts separately, but you'll see the related contacts to a company as a suggestion while doing so.

- If you've enabled the slider in **Settings > Calendar > Preferences > Show distances to meetings****, **Teamleader Focus will block the estimated travel time in your agenda based on your [set departure address](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692040007313-FAQ-How-can-I-edit-the-departure-address-of-a-meeting). When you choose to [invoice your meeting](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691017896081-How-To-Invoicing-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus), a standard cost per kilometer will be calculated as a separate position on your invoice. You can change the standard price by navigating to **Settings **> **Time Tracking **> **Preferences **> **Change cost per kilometer**.

 

Note: The cost per kilometer is only calculated when a special feature is activated in your account. One email to our [support team](https://support.teamleader.eu/en/support/tickets/new) is enough to make this option also available for your account.

 

## Location for a single use

- You need to fill in an address specific to this meeting.

- The distance and cost per kilometer is also calculated with this option in case the feature mentioned above is activated.

 

## Virtual meeting

- You do not need to fill in an address, the meeting will be held virtually, which means via phone, Skype, etc.

- Note that if you select an [online meeting room](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695076147601-How-To-Create-an-online-meeting-room-via-the-Lead-capture-Booster), the ‘Location’ of your meeting will be ‘Virtual meeting’ by default. If you do want to add a physical location, please remove the online meeting room first.

 

## Common locations

- These are default locations for meetings with customers.

- You can specify those under **Settings **> **Locations**.
