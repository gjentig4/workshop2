# FAQ: How can I manage common locations in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692263983249)

 

Often debating about whether or not you booked that meeting room between 3 and 4? Teamleader Focus will help you out! We offer a meeting room management feature, which works through an extended integration with Google Apps - Google resources. Unfamiliar with this? We recommend you start by reading [this article](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1686462?hl=en&ref_topic=1034362) first.

*Note that every user of your Teamleader Focus account needs his/her own Google Workspace account with a *[*Business Starter plan*](https://gsuite.google.com/pricing.html)* to be able to use this feature.*

 

To manage meeting rooms in Teamleader Focus, simply follow these steps:

- The general idea: in your Google Calendar, you can create multiple 'rooms'. Those will correspond with the meeting rooms in your office. Once created, you can assign one of these rooms to a meeting via Google Calendar. To make things easier, you can also assign those rooms straight away whenever you create or edit a meeting in Teamleader Focus.

- Go to '**Integrations/Marketplace' **in Teamleader Focus and select 'Google Resources'. At the bottom, you'll find a toggle asking you to activate Google Resources. Click on the toggle to synchronise your rooms with Teamleader Focus.

- Next, create a new meeting in Teamleader Focus. 

- In the location dropdown menu, you'll be able to choose **Resources**. If you click on this, you'll get a new menu that shows your own meeting rooms as resources.

*Note: if you've also activated the *[*Lead capture Booster*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster)* and selected an online meeting room, the ‘Location’ of your meeting will be ‘Virtual meeting’ by default. If you do want to add a resource, please remove the online meeting room first.*

- Complete the process by entering your meeting details and clicking Save. There you go, you've now successfully booked your meeting room

- Whenever someone attempts to book a meeting room that has already been booked, they will receive an error message and will be unable to save that meeting.

**Note:** If Teamleader Focus cannot retrieve your meeting rooms, go to admin.google.com > Security > API reference and make sure that "Enable API Access" is checked. Read [this article](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60757?hl=en) for more information.
