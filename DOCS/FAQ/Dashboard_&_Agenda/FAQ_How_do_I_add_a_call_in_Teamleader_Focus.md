# 1. Add a call via the dashboard

- The first possibility is to add a call on your dashboard by clicking the **"****plus sign"**

- Now you can complete the details of your call. The call is automatically assigned to the person who creates it, but you can easily assign it to a colleague as well. 

- To follow up your calls, you can set up call outcomes and follow-up actions specific to your process as explained in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691879792273-How-To-Adding-call-outcomes).
 

# 2. Add a call via the agenda module

- Another option is to go to **Calendar **> **Calls **and clicking on **Add call** there.

- You can also add a call by double-clicking in the agenda and selecting Add call.
 

# 3. Add a call via the plus sign

- A third way to add a call is to click on the **plus sign** in the top right hand corner and select "**add call"**.

- Now you can complete the details of your call as described above.

- Teamleader Focus will automatically complete the call with information depending on where you are when you click the plus sign. For example, if you open a contact in the CRM section and then click this plus sign, this contact person will automatically be added to the call.
 

# 4. Add a call via a deal

On your [deal page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) you can find the section 'Scheduled actions'. Click on the button **Call **to add a call and it will be automatically linked to your deal.

 

# 5. Add a call via import

In case you have planned some calls in your old system already, Teamleader Focus offers the option to[ import calls](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691695405201-How-To-Importing-calls-into-Teamleader-Focus).
