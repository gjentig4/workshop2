You can create a list of all the companies you didn’t visit in the course of the last year by setting up a new segment. 

- To do so, go to Companies and go to the dropdown menu next to the search field, where you choose for “**Create new segment**”.

- Name the segment, e.g. “Not visited the last year” and define a fitting rule. You best choose “Last meeting is more than X months ago” and fill then the number 12 in to specify that this segment is about a timespan of 12 months.

You create lists dealing with different time spans in the same way.
