When you navigate to **Agenda, **at the top of the screen above the calendar, you'll find an overview of tasks, calls and meetings. But which ones will you actually see here?

## Tasks

You'll find all due, overdue and scheduled tasks here, also the ones you've marked as 'done'. You can filter on tasks made by you, open tasks, closed tasks and [unassigned tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697667516817-How-To-Unassigned-tasks-in-Teamleader-Focus) by navigating to your smart segments:![Sidebar menu showing Smart Segments options in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691411698577)

 

## Calls

You'll find all due, overdue and scheduled calls here, also the ones you've marked as 'done'. As with the tasks, you can filter on the open or closed calls by navigating to your smart segments.

 

## Meetings

You'll find all meetings that haven't been marked as done yet.

 

Once you've tracked time on your tasks, calls or meetings, they can be found in the module 'Timesheets' with the user that tracked time on them, and in the activities (history) of the respective customer.

E.g. if you are looking for an overview of your finished meetings, go to **Timesheets** > **Export** > **View report** > select your time period > 'View' > look in the exported file for time trackings of the type 'Meeting'.
