Anyone who sends invoices or quotations to other countries would prefer the item descriptions to appear in a comprehensible form. Then at least the customer knows what they refer to.

You don’t want to create all your item descriptions two, three or more times with different names. That causes confusion and is unnecessary work. Fortunately Teamleader Focus offers a simple way to add a translation to items.

 

## Create a new custom field

- [First translate the name of the item](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690721741073-How-To-Translating-product-names-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Navigate to “**Settings**” and click on “**Custom fields**”

- Click on the “**+**” symbol next to “Custom fields”

- Type “Description [LANGUAGE CODE]” in the field next to “Name”. Make sure to fill in the [two letter language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code correctly

- Choose “Multiline text” as a type and select “Product” next to “For”![The 'Add Custom field' dialog box in Teamleader Focus for creating a new product field.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690864203921)

- Click on “**Advanced options**” and make a “Group” called “Translation” by clicking on “**Other**”

- Click on “**Save**”

- Repeat this action for the various languages

## Fill in your fields

- Navigate to “**Products**”

- Click on **Add product **in the top right-hand corner or edit an existing product

- Complete the form with all the necessary data

- On the detail page of the product, add the translation in the field “Description [LANGUAGE CODE]”. E.g. “Description ES Ordenador”
