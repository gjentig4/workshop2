# FAQ: Can I hide the unit cost of products from my employees?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693875338769)

You can hide the unit cost of your products from your colleague(s) if you want to. Find more information in this article.

 

## How

First of all, you need to have [admin rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) to be able to change the user rights of other users in the account.

 

Follow these steps to hide the unit cost for a certain user:

- Go to **Settings **> **Users**

- Click on **the name o****f the user**

- In 'Permissions' > 'Products', disable the toggle ‘Unit cost visible’.

Disabling this toggle alone will not suffice. In order to be able to hide the unit cost, you’ll also need to disable the toggle next to:

- Show costs on projects

- [Orders](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691460255505-FAQ-What-is-the-workflow-of-order-confirmations-orders-and-delivery-notes)

- [Margin on quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693029609233-How-To-Margin-and-markup-on-quotations)

 

Now, the user won’t be able to see the unit cost of a product when navigating to products. Keep in mind that the field ‘Main supplier’ also won’t be visible. **So these fields won't be visible anymore:**
