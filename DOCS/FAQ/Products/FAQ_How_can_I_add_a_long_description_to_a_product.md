# FAQ: How can I add a long description to a product?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691463188113)

 

If you want to add a long description to a product in the product module, open the product and click on the **pencil **in the top right hand side next to description.

 

In the next screen you'll also see a toggle allowing you to add the long description to quotations. If you choose "Yes", the long description will be used whenever you add this product to a new quotation. 

 

Remarks:

- To edit the description when creating your quotation, simply click the symbol with four horizontal lines next to the product line:

- Make sure you've added the shortcode $LONG_DESCRIPTION$ to your [quotation template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692647207057-How-To-Customizing-your-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus) to show the description on your quotations. 

- If you want to add the long description of a product automatically to your invoice or order, you need to activate this in your Settings:

Go to **Settings > Products > Preferences **

- To add the long description to your invoices, enable 'When adding a product to an invoice, include the product description'

- To add the long description to your orders, enable 'When adding a product to an order, include the product description'
