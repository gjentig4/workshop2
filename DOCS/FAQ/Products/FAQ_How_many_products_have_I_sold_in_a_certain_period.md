Interested in finding out what your best-selling products are? You can find an overview of this via Insights or via your Invoices overview.

 

# Insights

In [Insights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/28006164415889-How-To-Insights-in-Teamleader-Focus), you'll find a report in the library called 'Top products Sales'. This is a report over your product sales and is an overview of products sold the most as per accepted quotations this year. Change the date filters to see quarterly or monthly performance.
