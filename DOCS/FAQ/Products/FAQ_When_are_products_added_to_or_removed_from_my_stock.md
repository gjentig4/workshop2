If you are using our [stock management](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691712397713-How-To-Stock-management-in-Teamleader-Focus) function, it may be interesting to know which actions will affect your stock. Aside from changing the amounts manually, there are only two situations that will cause your stock to update automatically:

- Using the product on a booked invoice will decrease your stock. It is important to know that products used on quotations, work sheets, delivery notes etc. are not taken into account. If you delete or credit a booked invoice, the stock will also not be updated to the original amount again.

- Teamleader Focus has an option to create [orders](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691460255505-FAQ-What-is-the-workflow-of-order-confirmations-orders-and-delivery-notes) to send to your suppliers*.* On these orders you can add the products you need to replenish your stock and send the order in pdf. When your supplier has delivered the order, confirming this delivery will increase your stock.
