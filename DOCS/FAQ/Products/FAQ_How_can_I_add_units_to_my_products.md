# FAQ: How can I add units to my products?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

By default the articles in Teamleader Focus do not have fixed units like 'per meter' or 'per piece'. Fortunately, you can add this yourself.

- Go to **Settings **> **Products **> **Price units** and set the different price units you wish to use for your articles.

- From then on you will see an extra field when you create a product where you can set the unit this product comes in.

Notes:

- This option will also be visible when you create a quotation or an invoice. The set unit will be taken over automatically, but you also have the option to change it.

- If you want to see the unit on the quotation or the invoice, you need to adapt your template via **Settings **> **Document layout**. The required shortcodes are $UNITS_HEADER$ and $UNIT$. In [our Template Gallery](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693263841937-Welcome-to-our-Template-Gallery) (Variation 6 for quotations and 5 for invoices) you will find a functional variation where these shortcodes have been included already. You can use this variation or only copy-paste the table to your own template.
