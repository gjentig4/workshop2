# How to: How can I work with graduated prices?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691815998225)

- Go to** Settings** > **Custom fields** > **+**. 

- Create a custom field for "Products" called "Quantity" and the type should be "Single line text".

- Next, for every graduated price, create a product with a unique ID. You can do this by clicking on **Add product **under Products. Add the quantity to the custom field you just created.

- Once you're done, you can search for the product when creating a quotation or invoice.
