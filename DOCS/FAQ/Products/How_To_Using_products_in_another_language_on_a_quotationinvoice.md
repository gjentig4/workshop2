![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690911582737)

 

- Translate the[ names of your products](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690721741073-How-To-Translating-product-names-in-Teamleader-Focus) and [their descriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690897267601-How-To-Translating-product-descriptions-for-quotations-and-invoices-in-Teamleader-Focus) into the needed language.

- Make sure that you’ve saved the language of the contact and the company correctly in the contact or company details. Otherwise Teamleader Focus will use the original name of the item.
