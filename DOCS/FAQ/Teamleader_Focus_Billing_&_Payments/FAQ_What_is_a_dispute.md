# FAQ: What is a dispute?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693427273873)

 

If you pay by credit card, your bank can dispute the charged amount. This means the validity of a transaction that was registered to the account has been questioned. A couple of reasons for a dispute can be:

 

- Unauthorized charges

- Double charges

- Billing errors

- Expired card

 

In case of a dispute, you will receive an email from our invoicing department with the request to update your credit card details. You can for example [add a different credit card via your licence page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690987110929-FAQ-How-can-I-change-my-credit-card-or-bank-information-in-Teamleader-Focus). Afterwards, we will try to charge your card again.
