# How To: How can I change my billing info?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693425998353)

 

Follow these steps if you want to change your company name, your invoicing address or your VAT number:*You can only change your billing info on desktop and not on mobile.*

- Click your image (or your initials) in the top right-hand corner of your account.

- Select **Manage licence**.

- Navigate to 'Billing'.

- Select '**Update billing information**'.

Notes: 

 

- The VAT number you fill in here is only used for our Teamleader Focus invoices to you. If your VAT number changed you should not only adapt it here but also in your **Settings > Company information > **Click on the **company entity > Edit. **In 'Company details', you can edit your VAT number. Inserting the shortcode $DEPARTMENT_VAT_NUMBER$ on your document templates will then also display this number on the documents (quotations, invoices,...) you send to your customers.

Also double check if your old VAT number isn't entered as fixed text on your template instead of generated via a shortcode, otherwise you'll need to change the fixed text as well. 

- If you want these changes to be reflected on already existing invoices you'll need to adapt the invoice [as explained at the end of this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691148276241-How-To-How-can-I-edit-my-invoice)

- Changes to the billing information will only affect your future Teamleader Focus invoices. If you wish to make changes to past invoices, please [reach out to us](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065) and mention your account ID and requested changes.
