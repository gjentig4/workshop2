# FAQ: How can I change my credit card or bank information in Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

Stop worrying about outstanding invoices. When you add a card, payments will be handled automatically and taken from the credit card or debit card whenever your license is renewed. But what if your card details change when you change banks, or when your card expires?

*Only admin users have the rights to change this info.*

1. Go to your **icon user** in the upper right-hand corner of your Teamleader Focus account and click on **Manage ****licence**:

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the '**Payment method**' section.![Payment method section in Teamleader Focus showing a masked credit card and a change link.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690986528145)

3. Select '**Change**** payment method**' and add your new card details.![The payment method selection screen in Teamleader Focus for SEPA direct debit or credit card.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691010066193)

4. From now on, every time your license is renewed, the payment will automatically be charged and the invoicing team will send you an email with the payment confirmation plus the paid invoice as attachment.

If you have more questions about an invoice you received from Teamleader Focus let us know by sending an email to [invoicing.focus@teamleader.eu](mailto:invoicing.focus@teamleader.eu).
