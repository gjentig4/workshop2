# FAQ: How can I receive my invoices at a different e-mail address?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693394670609)

Does your company or finance administration use an e-mail address for invoices or do you want incoming invoices from Teamleader Focus to be sent to another specific mail address? Admin users can adjust this in the following way:

- Navigate to your profile picture in the top-right corner.

- Select **Manage licence.**

- Click on '**Update b****illing information'** to adjust the e-mail address.

As of now, invoices from Teamleader Focus will be sent to the newly inserted e-mail address.
