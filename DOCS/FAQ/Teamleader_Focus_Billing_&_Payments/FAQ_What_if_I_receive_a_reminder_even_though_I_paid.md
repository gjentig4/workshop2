If you paid your invoice, it may take some time before the amount is transferred to our account. If the reminder crossed your payment, you can happily ignore it. 

 

If you continue to receive reminders, we'll gladly look up the payment for you. It may be that a wrong communication was used, or a different amount was paid. In that case, you can send us a proof of payment via [invoicing.focus@teamleader.eu](mailto:invoicing.focus@teamleader.eu).

 

In case your account was suspended and you now paid the outstanding invoice, but still can't access your account, please send us payment proof as well.
