# FAQ: What do I do if my payment failed?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

Did you receive the notification your payment failed? Here's what happens.

### Credit card

If you pay by credit card, you will **receive an e-mail if your payment was declined**. Contact your bank or check your credit card details via the Teamleader Focus licence page if this is the case.

- Click your image in the upper right corner of your account.

- Select Manage licence.

- Navigate to '**Payment method**'.

Teamleader Focus will **retry charging the amount again after 5 days**. If still unsuccessful, a new mail will be sent and we'll have another go after another 5 days. 

If the payment comes through, you will receive a confirmation via mail. However, **if the payment could not be charged after 30 days, the account will be suspended**. This means users will no longer have access to the account.

### Direct Debit

The same goes for payments via direct debit, except that it takes a few days to process direct debit payments. This means we only charge 2 times during a period of 30 days. You'll receive a reminder every 7 days instead of 5. The account will be suspended when the invoice is 30 days overdue.

If you have more questions regarding your invoices from Teamleader Focus, send a mail to [invoicing.focus@teamleader.eu](mailto:invoicing.focus@teamleader.eu).
