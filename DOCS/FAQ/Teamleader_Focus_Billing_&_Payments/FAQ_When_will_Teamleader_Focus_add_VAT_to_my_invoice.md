# FAQ: When will Teamleader Focus add VAT to my invoice?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692922151697)

We are a Belgium based software company, so we are required to follow Belgian law when it comes to invoicing.

We do a syntax check on your VAT number according to the [EU taxation documentation.](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/faq.html#item_11)

Based on the VAT number we will invoice with or without Belgian VAT

For all customers in Belgium = 21% VAT

For EU based companies (With a valid VAT number) = 0%

For EU based customers (Without a valid VAT number) = 21%

For Outside EU based companies or customers = 0%
