# FAQ: Where can I find my Teamleader Focus invoices?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692647510289)

 

You received an invoice from Teamleader Focus but you can't find it in your mailbox and need a copy?

 

The **admin(s)** of each account will be able to find Teamleader Focus invoices and credit notes clicking on their profile picture in the right upper hand corner, going to **Manage license**. At the bottom of the page you will find the invoices (or credit notes) including the payment status.

**Why do I see multiple licenses on my Teamleader Focus invoice?**
Our prices are calculated per user license. Each package comes with a minimum of 2 licenses.

 

**Note: **Invoices from before the 18th of June 2019 won't be available. You can retrieve those by **s****ending **[**an email to our finance team**](mailto:invoicing@teamleader.eu)**.**

 

# Peppol

In order to receive your Teamleader Focus invoices via Peppol, your VAT needs to be registered on the [VIES database](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/?locale=en). If this was not the case when your account was set up, you'll receive the invoice via e-mail. You can contact us once your VAT has been registered and we'll send the invoice(s) via Peppol retroactively. You can always find your invoices on the license page as explained above.
