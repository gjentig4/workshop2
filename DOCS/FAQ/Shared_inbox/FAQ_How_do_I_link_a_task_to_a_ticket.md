# FAQ: How do I link a task to a ticket?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691928940817)

 

When you’re reading a customer's mail via our [shared inbox](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691088759057-How-To-Using-tickets-in-Teamleader-Focus), it’s possible you don’t have the time to reply right away or you need to do some further investigation first.

 

In this case, you can easily add a task linked to this ticket to make sure you don’t forget to get back to the customer later. 

- Just open the ticket, scroll down and click on the plus sign next to ‘Tasks’ to [add the task](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691951764497-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-task-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- In the task screen, you’ll see the customer has already been completed, and you can simply click on the ticket link to go back to the ticket. Back in the ticket you’ll notice that the task is added at the bottom, so you and your colleagues can keep track of who is working on what for this specific mail.

You can of course add as many tasks as you like to a single ticket by simply clicking the plus sign again.
