# FAQ: Can I add extra statuses to the shared inbox in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691049018769)

 

The shared inbox has 5 default statuses to assign to tickets. These are:

- 'New'

- 'Open'

- 'Waiting for customer'

- 'Escalated to third party'

- 'Closed'

 

You can add extra statuses that apply better to your way of working:

- Navigate to **Settings** **Shared inbox **** Custom statuses for tickets  **click the **plus **sign.

- Give your new status a name.

- Click on “**Save**”.

 

You will now see your new status appear in the drop-down list next to 'Status' when you edit a ticket.
