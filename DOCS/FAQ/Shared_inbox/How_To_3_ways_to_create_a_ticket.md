# How To: 3 ways to create a ticket

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691498257937)

 

If you are working with shared inbox in Teamleader Focus, you probably know by now that any person, customer, supplier etc can send you a ticket by sending an email to the support email address that you have set up in Teamleader Focus.

 

No idea what I am talking about? You can have a look at this article to find out [how to set up ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691088759057-How-To-Using-tickets-in-Teamleader-Focus)your shared inbox. Besides this, there are other 2 cases where you can create a ticket yourself if the customer has, for example, sent you an email to another email address, or if the issue was asked on the phone.

 

Therefore, in this article, we’ll explain the 3 ways to create a ticket in Teamleader Focus:

- Via email

- Via the Chrome plugin

- Manually

# Via email

As we mentioned in the beginning, if you have your shared inbox set up, emails from customers sent to your chosen support address will automatically end up in your Teamleader Focus account.

 

From there on, you can reply to the ticket directly or decide which user will do it. You can also use different templates to ensure the fastest possible response.

# Via the Chrome plugin

Our Google Chrome plugin doesn’t just allow you to track [incoming and outgoing email](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690832651921-How-To-Using-the-Chrome-extension-for-Teamleader-Focus-email-tracking), it also lets you create tasks and tickets straight from your mailbox.

 

Below every email that you receive, you will see a grey space provided by Teamleader Focus, where you can get three options: track the email, create a task or convert the email into a ticket.

 

This last option will save the email as a ticket in your shared inbox and will let you answer in the same way as if a ticket was sent to your support email address.

# Manually

Of course, there is always the manual solution. If, for example, a customer asks you a question in person or via telephone, you can still create a ticket by clicking on **Add ticket** in your shared inbox. Just enter your customer’s name, a subject and a status and click ‘Save’.

 

You get the same layout as a normal ticket, only no message has been typed yet. Add one via an internal note or just email the customer the answer to his question straight from within the ticket.

 

This way, a customer’s question still gets tracked and makes it easy to follow up.
