# FAQ: How does Teamleader Focus add replies to the right ticket?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

When a [ticket is created](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691088759057-How-To-Using-tickets-in-Teamleader-Focus), Teamleader Focus makes sure every reply is added to the thread of the right ticket. This is evident if your customers make use of the [Ticketcloud; ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692671381393-How-To-Using-Ticketcloud)they click the link, the ticket history is shown and they reply directly to the thread. But how exactly do we do this when your contact replies directly from his or her mailbox?

 

At the bottom of every reply sent from your shared inbox, a **ticket reference **is added. This is the reference used by Teamleader Focus to make sure a customer's answer to your response is added to the right ticket.

This is both a safe and reliable way to make sure the right reply is added to the right ticket! However, don't confuse the ticket reference with the ticket ID.![Header view of a new support ticket in Teamleader Focus showing contact and company details.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693293158673)

 

The **ticket ID** you find at the top of the ticket page can be used only as a reference for your customers to refer to a specific ticket.
If you add the variable for the ticket ID to your [autoreply ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691071132689-How-To-Setting-up-autoreplies-in-the-shared-inbox-in-Teamleader-Focus)(via **Settings > Shared inbox > Autoreply**), this will not result in replies automatically being linked to the right thread in Teamleader Focus. This means that if your customer replies to a ticket in a new e-mail without answering the original ticket, a new ticket will be created in Teamleader Focus even if the ticket ID is mentioned in the e-mail.
