You also have the option to keep a copy of all forwarded messages in Outlook.

 

## iCloud

 

When [using Mail on iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/mail), you can have all your iCloud Mail messages forwarded automatically to another email account. You may find this helpful if you use the Teamleader Focus shared inbox.

- Click the Action pop-up menu ![A simple gray gear icon representing the settings or configuration menu.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691348924817) in the iCloud sidebar, then choose **Preferences**.

- In the General pane, select “**Forward my email to**”, then type the forwarding address in the text field.

- 
If you don’t want to store a copy of each forwarded message in iCloud, select “Delete messages after forwarding.”

Keep in mind that storing copies of forwarded messages decreases your available iCloud storage space.

- Click **Done**.

You can also specify criteria so that only certain messages are forwarded. When you set up a rule to forward certain messages to another account, you can only use one forwarding address for each rule.
