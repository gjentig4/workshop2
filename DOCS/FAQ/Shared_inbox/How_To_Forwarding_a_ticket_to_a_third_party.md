If you would like to forward a ticket to someone outside the Teamleader Focus account, then just follow those steps:

- Go to **Settings** > **Shared inbox >** "Preferences" > Activate the toggle "Enable third party ticket forwarding"

- Go to the ticket in question and you will see the additional button "Third party" next to "Internal note" and "Public reply".

- Click on "**Third party**".

- Add a message to the third party. This conversation will not be visible to your customer.

- Fill in a customer. This can be a known contact in your CRM or you can add a new one.

- Click "**Send to third party**".

 

Note: This feature is activated per user, so only the user(s) that activate this toggle in Settings > Shared inbox will be able to see it and use it.
