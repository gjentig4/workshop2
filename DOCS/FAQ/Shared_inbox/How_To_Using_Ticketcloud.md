In this article, we will talk about three things:

- What is Ticketcloud?

- How can I change the layout of Ticketcloud?
 

## What is Ticketcloud?

Ticketcloud is an online page you can share with your customer to give him or her an overview of their current outstanding tickets.

- The status of the ticket can be viewed from within the platform

- The customer can answer the ticket by clicking on 'reply' and they can even add an attachment

- The answer of the customer will then be sent and registered in your shared inbox in Teamleader

- In the 'ticket history', your customers can view all open tickets. There, tickets that have the status 'closed' won't be shown however

 

Ticketcloud is a similar platform as [Invoicecloud](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692202362257-How-To-Set-up-InvoiceCloud). This platform also shows the customer an online overview of outstanding/past invoices.

 

## How can I use Ticketcloud?

In order to send a link to the online platform to your customers, you need to follow these steps.

- Navigate to **Settings** > **Shared inbox **> **Preference**

- Enable the slider "Use ticketcloud to share tickets online"

- Whenever your customers send you a ticket, they will receive an autoreply bearing the link to Ticketcloud.

## How can I change the layout of Ticketcloud?

- Go to **Settings **> **Cloudplatforms**. 

- Click on **Cloud platform layout settings** 

- Upload a background picture.The ideal size of your picture in JPG format is 1920x1080 px.
