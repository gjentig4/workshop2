# FAQ: Can I copy time tracking?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

 

You can easily duplicate your tracked time in Teamleader Focus. Read more about copying time tracking here.

 

## Why

It might be handy to copy an existing time tracking to another moment in time when you for example did the same work but for another customer. Or when you did the same work but on a different day. Or when you tracked time on a task but that one time it was billable and now it isn’t.

 

Basically, you can change anything you want to the time tracking whilst copying it.

 

## How

To copy a time tracking, follow these steps:

- Navigate to **Timesheets**

- Click on the three dots next to a time tracking in your time tracking overview

- Choose **Copy**

- Change the info of the time tracking where needed

- Click on **Save** 
 

If you’d like to add time trackings at once to a complete week, we advise you to make use of our weekly time tracking feature. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

## Note

Bear in mind that it's not possible to copy time tracking you already charged/invoiced to the customer.
