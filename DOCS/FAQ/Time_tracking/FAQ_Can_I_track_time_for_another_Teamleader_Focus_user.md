Yes, if you have certain rights in Teamleader Focus you can! You need to be:

- An [admin user](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) 

- [The leader of a team](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697980641681-FAQ-What-rights-does-the-leader-of-a-team-have)

 

If you need to track time for another Teamleader Focus user, you can follow these steps:

 

1. Go to **Timesheets** and switch to another user in the right-hand corner.
![The Timesheets overview in Teamleader Focus showing time tracking stats and user selection.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691642175633)

2. Click on **Add time tracking **in the top right-hand corner. Here you can choose to add single or [multiple time trackings](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus). 

For this example we choose **single time tracking:**
![The 'Add time tracking' dialog box in Teamleader Focus for logging work hours.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/26664947853969)
You will see a warning that you are adding time for another user, but you can simply add all the information you normally fill in when adding time. Click **save **afterwards and the time tracking has been added.

If you choose to add **multiple time trackings** at once you can also add them from your planning. You'll receive the same warning that you're tracking time for another user.

Note: These are the only ways to track time for another user. You cannot track time on tasks, calls or meetings for another user as the tracked time of a meeting, a call or task will always be added to the timesheets of the user that is logged in.
