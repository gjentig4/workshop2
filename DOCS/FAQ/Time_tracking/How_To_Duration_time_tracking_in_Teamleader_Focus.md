When registering time in Teamleader Focus, we'll ask you to choose a date and also a start and stop time for your time tracking.

 

It's however also possible to only register the duration of the time tracking instead of the from-to time tracking. Tracking time in Teamleader Focus will then look like this:

To set this up, follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings > Time tracking**

- In **Preferences**, go to 'Time tracking input'

- Select 'Duration'.

 

Note that this setting for the time tracking input is an **account-wide** setting, meaning every user in the account will then register time tracking according to duration.

 

## Note

When adding [weekly time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus), all time trackings are registered by **duration **by default.
