If you do so, the tracked time will be grouped by type, e.g. work type, meeting or call.

 

You will not see any details of the time tracking on the invoice, as you have the option to send a time tracking report along with the invoice.

Much like other Teamleader Focus documents, the time tracking report is also customisable. 

- To do so, simply navigate to **Settings** > **Document layout** > **Time tracking report**. 

- To also add the description of the time tracking to the time tracking report, you need to add the shortcode $DESCRIPTION$ to the template of your Time tracking report.

- If you then upload this document to Teamleader Focus, the description of the time tracking will appear when you send a time tracking report along with your invoice.
