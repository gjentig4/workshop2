# How To: Reopen time tracking after crediting an invoice

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25695374786065)

 

After you’ve [credited an invoice](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692421867409-FAQ-How-do-I-create-a-credit-note) you might want to reopen the time tracking that was attached to that invoice, in order to edit it or to invoice it again if needed. Read this article to discover how.

 

# Fully credit original invoice

First, you need to make sure that the invoice with the time tracking in question was **fully credited**. This means that for partly credited invoices, time trackings can’t be reopened.

 

After the invoice has been fully credited, the time tracking will have the label ‘Credited’ next to it in the timesheets overview, and only then will you be able to reopen the time tracking.

# Note

**Deleting an invoice (draft or booked) automatically reopens the linked time tracking. **
Also note that you should only delete an invoice if it hasn’t been sent to your customer yet. Deletion of an invoice isn’t possible if the invoice has already been synced with your accounting software.
