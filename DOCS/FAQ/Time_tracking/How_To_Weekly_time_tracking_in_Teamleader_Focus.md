With the feature of weekly time tracking in Teamleader Focus, you don’t need to add separate time tracking each day, but you can just track time for the entire week in one go. Discover everything about the feature in this article!

## Why

A decent **operational ****performance **is crucial for entrepreneurs and their businesses, and especially having insights into these operations. The **basis **for all calculations related to operation performance is **time ****tracking**. If you and your colleagues thoroughly track time, you can quickly gain more insight into your entire business’s efficiency and billability. 

 

A lot of our customers need to** track time for an entire week in one go**: this is much more efficient and less time-consuming. Instead of having to add time tracking one by one, the weekly time tracking feature offers the solution to track time for a whole week by duration*.

**Note: Tracking time using duration only is easier and quicker to fill out and at the end of the week instead of using a start and end time and having to accurately remember all timings.*

 

Take a few minutes on Friday for example to fill out your timesheets for the past week. Weekly Time Tracking can be the only thing standing between you and the weekend.

 

## How

You can find the feature to add multiple time trackings by following these steps:

- Navigate to your **Timesheets **in Teamleader Focus

- In the top right-hand corner, you find the button **Add multiple time trackings**
**![Action buttons for time tracking: Export, Add multiple time trackings, and Add time tracking.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/26664100835217)**

- You can choose to add multiple time trackings **Manually** or [**From your planning,** which you can read more about here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/26653504659089-How-To-Convert-your-planning-to-timesheets-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- If you choose 'Manually', then on the left, select the item you want to track time on and fill out the details
![The 'Add multiple time trackings' form in Teamleader Focus for selecting work items.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693813547921)
You can add a description for each item by clicking next to the trash bin. Every time tracking for that item will have the same description.
![The duplicate icon in Teamleader Focus, highlighted with a red box next to a trash icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693768742929)

- Indicate the hours and/or minutes worked per day on the right side. Note that you need to insert a **duration **here.

- This can be **repeated **for different items as many times as you need to, to account for all the work you have performed.
![Weekly timesheet view in Teamleader Focus for tracking billable hours across projects and contacts.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693813626769)

- Indicate if the time tracking should be **billable **or not.

- To make it even easier to track time on the right items, you can take a look at ‘Suggestions from your calendar’. These are based on **scheduled **tasks in your calendar.

![The 'Suggestions from your calendar' widget in Teamleader Focus for time tracking.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693782618385)

Click on the green check mark to accept the suggestion, or on the cross to dismiss it. 

- 
*Note*: *once a suggestion is dismissed for this week, it won’t show up again. If a task is scheduled over multiple weeks however, it will still be suggested for the weeks to come.*

- Click on **Add ****x time tracking(s)** and voila, all your time trackings for this week are added!

 

## What (specifics)

Now that you know how to actually add your weekly time tracking, this paragraph will zoom in on some specifics of the weekly time tracking feature.

- The weekly time tracking feature supports a **keyboard-first approach** for easy entry and navigation
![The 'Add multiple time trackings' dialog showing a weekly grid to log hours for a project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693793806097)

Use the **tab** on your keyboard to easily navigate through the days of the week 

- Use the **arrows **on your keyboard to add or subtract time 

- Below the ‘Suggestions from your calendar’, you’ll find the **amount of time already tracked** per day this week:

![The 'Suggestions from your calendar' section in Teamleader Focus for time tracking.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693799275153)

- You can also find a **progress ****bar **on your timesheets overview that fills up according to the time tracked:

When adding multiple time trackings, durations will be added to the timesheets overview:
![Time tracking overview showing daily progress bars for recorded hours.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693799308433)

- 
*Note:* When only single time trackings were added with a start and end time, the time tracked will be shown on a timeline. You can fill up the timeline of a day by clicking on the gaps to add time to those parts:

![Weekly timesheet overview in Teamleader Focus showing tracked hours and billable time statistics.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693813907985)

 

The moment a duration time tracking gets added, the timeline will be replaced by the above progress bar.
E.g. progress bar on the 23rd of August vs a timeline on the 25th of August:

![Time tracking input field showing a start time of 9:00 AM and end time of 5:00 PM.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693814103185)

- The above also means it’s possible to **track time in the future**, so you can bill your customer earlier for work expecting to be done or keep better track of your planning.

- 
You can also **track time for someone else** when navigating to that colleague in the timesheets overview:

Notes

- The Weekly Time Tracking view is only accessible from the timesheets overview 

- Suggestions from your calendar only take into account scheduled tasks, and don’t include companies that you’ve recently visited, tasks with due dates etc.
When adding time trackings in bulk, you can’t select calls, meetings or tickets to track time on

- Take a look at [how to copy time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693842194577-FAQ-Can-I-copy-time-tracking) if you only need to duplicate one specific time tracking.
