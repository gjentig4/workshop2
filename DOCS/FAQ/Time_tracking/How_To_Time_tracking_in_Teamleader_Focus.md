## Via our Time Tracker

Our Time Tracker functionality is essentially a timer in the top right-hand corner in Teamleader Focus. It allows you to keep an eye on how long you’ve already been working on something at all times. You can very easily start the timer and then stop it when you’re finished. [Read all about it in this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693342367249-How-To-Track-time-with-Teamleader-Focus-Time-Tracker-functionality)!

## Manually

### Quick start menu

- When in Teamleader Focus click on the “**+**” symbol in the upper right-hand corner. Then click “**T****ime Tracking**”.

![The 'Plus' (+) quick-action menu in Teamleader Focus for creating new items.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690708988945)

- Fill in the details.

- Click “**Add time tracking"** and the amount of time will be added to your timesheets.

 

### Timesheets

- Navigate to “Timesheets”

- Click on **Add time tracking **in the top right-hand corner or click on the timer symbol next to a specific day

- Fill in the details

- Click “**Save**” and the amount of time will be added to your timesheets.

**Additional ways to track time via timesheets:**

- You can add new time trackings by clicking on the gaps in the timeline directly:
![Adding time tracking to a specific date in the Teamleader Focus timesheet view.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690709023377)

- You can create new time trackings by copying them. Read more [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693842194577-FAQ-Can-I-copy-time-tracking). 

 

## Via a task, call or meeting

A third way to register time you spent is via tasks, calls or meetings you created in advance. The time registered is different for each of these however:

- Task: when tracking time on a task, the proposed time spent will be the time since you logged in (if it’s the first time tracking of the day) or the time spent since finishing your previous time tracking.
*Note:* It's not possible to delete a task when there's already time tracked on it. You have to delete the time tracking in order to delete the task. It will only be possible to delete time tracking when it hasn't been invoiced yet.

- Call: when you’re calling a contact using one of our Voice-over-IP services, the time spent on the call will automatically be registered to your timesheets. If you finish the call manually, you can enter your spent time yourself.

- Meeting: when telling Teamleader Focus that a meeting is done, the time proposed will be the previously set duration of the meeting. If you set that the meeting would take an hour when creating it, a time tracking of an hour will be proposed. You can easily overrule this, of course.

 

## Via weekly time tracking

With the feature of weekly time tracking in Teamleader Focus, you don’t need to add separate time tracking each day, but you can just track time for the entire week in one go. Discover everything about the feature in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)!

 

## Via the mobile app

Our Teamleader Focus mobile app also lets you not only time track tasks, calls and meetings from your phone or tablet, it also features the option of start/stop time tracking. How the time is registered depends on what you are doing:

- Task: you can start time tracking for a task on mobile by clicking through on it to see the details, then click on 'Track time' and you’ll be able to enter the tracked time yourself. You can also run the time tracker and select this task to track time.

- Call: the mobile app allows you to call straight from your phone. The time you actually spent on the call will be registered to your timesheets.

- Meeting: when clicking through on a meeting in the app, the same principle applies as it does with tasks. Click on the three dots to either start the automatic time tracking or to enter the time already spent. The duration of the meeting will again be proposed.

- Time sheets: go to “Time sheets” in the menu and click “start” in the upper right hand corner. The time tracking starts right away.

## Via work orders

The work orders feature in Teamleader Focus is our final way to track time. It allows you to go to your customer, track the time and material you spent there and create an invoice out of it. You can find more info on how this feature works in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690927285777-How-To-From-work-order-to-invoice).

 

## Notes

- 
When adding time tracking, it's also possible to add extra costs or products to it in the next step. If you don't see this option in your account, [please contact us.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065)
![Duration section in Teamleader Focus for logging time with date, start/end times, and extra costs.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690700032785)

- 
There is a user setting when it comes to allowing adding time tracking on projects. Go to **Settings **> **Users **> **click on the name of a user** > 'Permissions'** **> 'Time tracking':
![Time tracking and project access permissions settings in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/37466254746769)
 

Here, you can define if a user can add time tracking on no projects (disabled), according to participation on the project (participant only) or on all projects (all). 

- Next to that, this setting makes it also possible for users to track time on projects even if they don't have access to the project module.

- 
**Prefill** start and end time of time tracking: by default, the start time of a new time tracking will be right after your previous time tracking ended. When adding a time tracking to a day in the past:
 

If you have the [week schedule functionality and set up a week schedule for a user:](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691870457873-FAQ-How-can-I-set-a-week-schedule-in-Teamleader-Focus)

If the day in the past doesn't have time tracking, then when you add a new time tracking, the start time of the time tracking will be prefilled with the start time of your week schedule e.g. 8:30 in the morning.
 

- If the day in the past already had time tracking, then the start time of the time tracking starts at the end time of the latest time tracking on that day

- 
If you don't have a week schedule: 
By default, the start time of a new time tracking at the beginning of each day will be 9 in the morning.

- 
The duration that is prefilled for a new time tracking will be 1 hour by default, unless when your work day (according to the default 9 to 5 schedule or according to your personalised week schedule) already ended; then 15 minutes will be prefilled.

 

### Insights

Our Insights module also offers several reports on time tracking, such as the time efficiency per employee or an overview of the time tracking per customer.
