## Via the company/contact detail page

- Go to “**Contacts**” or “**Companies**”

- On the detail page of every contact or company you tracked time for, you will find “Unbilled time spent”. Click on “**Actions**” and choose “**Create invoice**”

- Click “**Go**”. You’ve now invoiced your time trackings

 

### Total to be invoiced

You can find an overview of the total amount to be invoiced per contact or company by navigating to the contacts or companies overview and adding the column 'Total to be invoiced' to the overview via the cogwheel in the bottom right-hand corner.

- This amount is the sum of the value of the tracked time and the value of the linked products.  

- This column only shows the hours/products linked to that customer directly, and not the hours/products linked to a project of that customer. You can invoice these time trackings via the project itself. [Find more information here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- You can sort on this column as well as create segments. An example of a segment could be to only show the contacts/companies that have an amount to be invoiced larger than €0:

## Via the time tracking overview - invoice unbilled time

- Navigate to **Revenue **> **Invoices**

- Click on the **Invoice unbilled time **in the top right-hand corner.
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691053614353)

- Now you see an overview of all unbilled hours per customer, where you can specify which time trackings you want to invoice. Confirm the action by clicking on the** toggles**. You can click on multiple toggles.

- Click “**Preview**” at the bottom of the page

- Teamleader Focus will tell you how many invoices will be created. Click the** toggle** and click “**Do now**”.
*Note: *Several time trackings of one customer can be grouped to one invoice

 

## Via the projects overview page or the project 

As **unbilled time trackings of projects don't show up in the invoice unbilled time overview **above, you have to invoice them a different way. [You can do this via the project itself, or in bulk via the projects overview page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

## Via prepaid billing

You can also invoice time tracking via prepaid billing. [Read all about it here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691379144465-FAQ-How-does-prepaid-billing-work-in-Teamleader-Focus)
