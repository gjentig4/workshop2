To set up your team accessibilities go to your [Team settings](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/team/settings/). These team options are based on back-end settings which have a smaller visual impact.

**Non-admins can see and edit the meetings of other team members:** If the box is unchecked non-admin team members won't be able to see meetings of other team members.** **

# Team meeting room access

**Meeting room access level for team admins: **choose the default access that team admins have for team meetings rooms, this option doesn't apply for non-admin team members.

**Default team access for meetings**: choose the default access that team members have for visiting each other's meeting rooms.

For both options you can choose between:

- Should knock: Team members should knock before they can enter the meeting room of another team member.

- Can always join: Team members can always enter the meeting room of another team member without having to knock. The meeting room owner doesn't have to be in the meeting room.

- Is host: Team members will have the same rights as the meeting room owner.

*Note: team admins will always have the highest access of the above options. *

*Eg. If the team admin access is 'Should knock' but meeting room access level for team members is 'Can always join', the admins will also have 'Can always join' access.*

**Allow overriding the team access level for individual meeting rooms: **When the checkbox is unchecked all meeting rooms will have the above setting as default. It's not possible to change this in a separate meeting room.
