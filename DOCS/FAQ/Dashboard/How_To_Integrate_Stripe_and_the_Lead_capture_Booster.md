# How To: Integrate Stripe and the Lead capture Booster

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694955212945)

It's possible to add payment options to your meeting types in the Lead capture Booster. This means that customers will have to pay for the meeting before the meeting is booked.

 

Integrations are on the organization level, meaning that every team member will be connected to the connected integration. Follow these steps to collect payments per appointment type.

 

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

Once you're connected you will see a green box that shows that you're successfully connected.

 

# 2. Add payment options to meeting types

Head to your [scheduling page](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/scheduling) to add payment options to meeting types.

 

[Create a new meeting type](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694606512401-How-To-Create-a-meeting-type-for-your-personal-booking-page) or edit an existing one. Scroll down until you see Powerful extensions. Click here on **Collect ****payments **to add the payment requirement and activate 'Require payment when booking a meeting'. 

 

Now you can:

- 
Add the amount

- 
Select the right currency

- 
Add payment terms or a link to your own payment terms page

Click on **Save**.

# 3. Visit your booking page to see the result

Visit your booking page to see how it shows in your meeting types. If you visit the booking page in the same browser where you're also logged in, you will not be able to go to the checkout page.

 

*tip: Visit your booking page in another browser or an incognito window so you can follow all the steps.*

If someone tries to book a meeting but doesn't pay immediately (or closes the Stripe checkout page), the time slot will be blocked for 24 hours but the meeting will not show in your calendar.

 

After 24 hours the meeting will be removed and the time slot will be available again if the customer didn't pay.

 

Happy selling!
