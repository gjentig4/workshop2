# Brand

The Brand settings allow you to customise your meeting rooms and booking pages with your own logo, favicon and brand color, and for the meeting rooms you can e.g. set up a background image.

  *Note: the logo, favicon and color you set up here also impacts the branding on your [contact forms.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695775141649-How-To-Contact-forms-and-how-to-create-them) *

 

## Company logo and favicon

The **company logo** can be added and shown instead of the default logo. This gives the first customisation to your meeting rooms, booking pages and communication. The optimal size is a width that is 3 to 8 times larger than the height.

 

The **Favicon** is a small icon which will show in your browser tab next to team name.
The optimal size for the favicon has a 1:1 ratio. 

 

You can **add your logo in the left top corner** **of new whiteboards**. Select the checkbox 'auto-add your logo to the whiteboard pages' to activate this.
![Logo settings for whiteboard pages in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694743358225)

 

## Homepage

Homepage is linked to the company logo. If someone clicks on your logo they can be redirected to the homepage. So if you upload your company logo and add your website (eg. mydomain.com) in homepage, people will be redirected to your website after clicking on the logo.

 

## Brand colour

You can easily add a brand colour so all the main buttons in your meeting rooms or your booking pages will have the same colour. Fill in the Hex code of the colour your prefer. You can check the colour in the preview in combination with white text.
![The brand color setting field with a hex code input and a preview button.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694743415185)

 

Now visit your meeting rooms or booking pages to check what the brand colour looks like there.

 

## Waiting room background vs meeting room background

The waiting room background and meeting room background can be different and show in different locations. The waiting room background shows on the welcome screen. If a customer opens the meeting room in the browser they will have to fill in a name and select one of the audio/video options. The background on this page is the waiting room background.

 

The meeting room background is the background in the meeting room, where you actually have the meeting. Both images need to be at least 1000px wide and high.

We recommend an image of 1920x1080px.

## Camera background image

You can set up a camera background image for all your team members. The camera background image will show you but will hide the rest of your location. This can also be a branded image. [Check out this help article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694122123025-FAQ-How-to-set-up-an-image-background-for-your-camera) for more information!

# Advanced branding

The advanced branding settings allow you to fully customise your meeting rooms and booking pages.

 

## Powered by Teamleader

![Advanced branding setting to show or hide the 'Powered by Teamleader' label.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/29118166733201)The option 'Show Powered by Teamleader' is checked by default. 
If enabled, then the label 'Powered by Teamleader' will be shown at the bottom of your booking pages, contact forms and meeting rooms. 
If disabled, then the label won't be visible.

 

**Special cases**

- If you have a custom logo set and this option is enabled, then the Powered by Teamleader label will be shown. 

- If you don't have a custom logo set and this option is enabled, then the Teamleader logo will be shown without the Powered by Teamleader label.

- For embedded contact forms this is different; the label will show if the option is enabled no matter the logo. And the label won't show if the checkbox is disabled.
 

## Custom email HTML template

You can change the layout of your email templates so it fits your companies branding. You can find more info in [this help article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694963991185-FAQ-Can-I-change-the-layout-of-my-meeting-and-invite-emails)!

 

# Custom text strings

In this part, you can change the text which shows on the waiting screen when a guest tries to enter the meeting room. You can do this for the message when the host is not in the meeting room yet and when the host is in the meeting room.

 

If you're not satisfied with the changes, you can reset the text to default by clicking on the button 'Reset to default'.

![Settings page for customizing text strings for meeting host waiting rooms.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694743608721)
 

 

# Legal

 

In the final part of the customisation settings you can set up terms and conditions for Scheduling and Contact forms. When customers book an online meeting or fill out a contact form, they often want to be informed about the privacy of their data.

 

The terms and conditions will be shown next to a checkbox on your booking pages and contact forms. The customer will have to agree before they can submit the booking or contact form.

 

By default, the Teamleader privacy policy will be linked and will be displayed in the language of your account. For guests, the privacy policy will be in the language of their browser.
![Legal settings for Scheduling and Contact Forms in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/27757187121041)

**Custom privacy policy**

You can also put your own custom text in this field, and optionally add URL's that link to your company's privacy policy and/or terms and conditions. To do the latter, add [link text](url).

 

If you don't want to display a privacy policy, you can also leave this field empty.
*Note: *we don't recommend to leave this empty for GDPR reasons.
