# FAQ: What happens if I update the team name in the Lead capture Booster?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694912196753)

If you change the team name in the Lead capture Booster, it will update your meeting room, waiting room and booking page links. 

To change your team name, go to **Settings > Customization > **Team name. You'll see the following warning about the implications for the URL:

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694895941521)
The link contains several parts:

- The Teamleader Focus cloud domain

- The team name

- Meeting-rooms, waiting-rooms or bookings

- Meeting room key, waiting room key (personal or team), booking link identifier (team, user and/or meeting type)

Old links won't work anymore so don't forget to inform your customers/guests about this.
