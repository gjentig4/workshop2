# How To: The Teamleader Focus integration in the Lead capture Booster

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694988534545)

 

Thanks to the integration between Teamleader Focus and the Lead capture Booster, new guests that schedule a meeting via a team member's personal booking page in the Lead capture Booster, can automatically result in new contacts in your Teamleader Focus account. Optionally, the same could be done for deals and companies.

All new customers who schedule a meeting but cannot be linked to a contact in Teamleader Focus, will automatically result in a new contact in your Teamleader Focus account. Also, all meeting details will be added to this contact.

 

Optionally, you can choose to create a new company and deal, and to send the calendar events to your calendar in Teamleader Focus.

 

You can find more information about these functions [in this meeting types help article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694496632593-How-To-Create-a-meeting-type-for-your-personal-booking-page-as-a-team-admin#3.1-Ask-questions)!

 

## **Create a calendar event through Teamleader Focus**

When the checkbox "Create a calendar event through Teamleader Focus" is enabled, a calendar event is created in Teamleader Focus and written through to [the online calendar that is configured in Teamleader Focus.](https://marketplace.focus.teamleader.eu/)

 

Make sure to connect the same calendar in your [Lead capture Booster scheduling configuration](https://meeting.teamleader.eu/scheduling/social-accounts/connect/) as in your Teamleader Focus Marketplace for an optimal scheduling experience.

You are now ready for a smoother CRM flow! Good luck!

 

# Permissions in Teamleader Focus

When connecting the integration you will have to make sure that the relevant team members have all the permissions in Teamleader Focus. 

We recommend to activate the following modules to have optimal usage of the integration:

- Contacts (Required!)

- Companies

- Deals

- Calendar

 

When the Contacts module is not activated in Teamleader Focus, the integration will not work and a warning will be displayed.
