![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34789505539473)*! Note that you need to have the Advanced insights Booster to use this functionality. Read more about it *[*here*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34775080480913-FAQ-What-are-the-key-features-of-the-Advanced-insights-Booster)*.*
 

Tracking and comparing your data over time is essential for understanding business performance and making informed decisions. With customised reports and the ability to group and compare data, you can easily spot patterns and identify key growth opportunities. Read all about it here!

# How

Comparing data over time allows you to see how your business performed month over month or year over year. Comparing your data this year with your data last year might prove very insightful as you can spot trends here, draw conclusions from this and take action.
 

## Premium reports

The Insights Booster gives you access to two Premium reports that compare metrics over time by default, [the Year-on-year Sales report](https://focus.teamleader.eu/insights/library-reports/683e20d4-38a8-4673-8483-e2631cf064d6) and the [Year-on-year Revenue report.](https://focus.teamleader.eu/insights/library-reports/62e83c3c-bc71-410e-8cfb-dc27df353cc4)

- 
**Open one of these reports **e.g. the year-on-year sales report

- You’ll immediately see a **line chart **with a comparison of your sales over the years. Each year has a different colour to visualise the difference at a glance:

*Note: *you can of course represent the data on a bar chart as well by changing the view in the top right-hand corner.
 

- In the **table **you can find the same comparative metrics. Expand the data by clicking on the name of the month:

## Add comparative metrics to your customised reports

Next to the premium reports you can of course also add these comparative metrics to other library reports or to your own customised reports too. 
 

Basically it’s all about grouping on the same field twice. We’ll explain this with an example below.
 

Follow these steps to add comparative metrics to a report:

- 
**Open **a report e.g. ‘Deal cycle time’

- Click on ‘Group by’.

Add the field ‘Date added’ twice, one with ‘Name of month’ filled out and one with ‘Year’, like in this screenshot:

- Filter on the field ‘Date added’ and choose ‘After’ a certain date X:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34789505562385)
 

- Your metrics will be visualised over time with a comparison between the years:![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34789521539217)

- As stated above you can also consult the metrics over time in your table and expand the rows.
