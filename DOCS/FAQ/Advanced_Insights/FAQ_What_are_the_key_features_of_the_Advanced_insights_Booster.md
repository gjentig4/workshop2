## Express values as percentages
![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/38769859066257)

- Instantly compare how each value contributes to the total by adding a percentage column to any number-based column. 

- Follow these steps to add percentage columns to your table:

**Open **a report

- In your table, click on the **three dots **in a number-based column

- 
Click on **Add as percentage column**.

In the example of the '[Revenue report](https://focus.teamleader.eu/insights/library-reports/805e40ff-7238-43b5-915c-5d57b09dfe8f)' you'll be able to see how much revenue each month provided relatively by adding the percentage column above.

The total you see depends on your own filters, so if you narrow or broaden your search, the total percentage remains.

- From here you can treat the column like any other, and move it to the front of the table to use it in charts.  

*Note: *This feature only works for number-based columns and won't be visible on the 'Count' column, other percentage fields or [custom created formulas.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34775166155281-How-To-Add-formulas-to-your-insights-reports-in-Teamleader-Focus)
