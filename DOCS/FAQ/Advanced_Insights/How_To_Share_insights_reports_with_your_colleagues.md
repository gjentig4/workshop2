# How To: Share insights reports with your colleagues

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)*! Note that you need to have the Advanced insights Booster to use this functionality. Read more about it *[*here*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34775080480913-FAQ-What-are-the-key-features-of-the-Advanced-insights-Booster)*.*

Every report in insights [can be configured to match your needs](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/28006164415889-How-To-Insights-in-Teamleader-Focus). And it doesn’t end there, as you can easily share those customised reports with colleagues and collaborate on them. This article shows you how, while also explaining the difference between giving view-only access or edit access to a report.

 

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

 

# Who

After you’ve created a report and configured it exactly as you wanted, you can share this report internally amongst your colleagues. This way you can easily look at the data together or collaborate to further refine the reports. 

- Everyone with user access to ‘Insights’ has the ability to create and share reports, you don’t need [admin rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) for that.

- As creator of a report you immediately become the ‘owner’ of the report too, meaning you can share it with others.
*Note: *[Library reports are present by default in your account ](https://focus.teamleader.eu/insights)and cannot be shared with anyone, as they are visible to everyone anyway.
 

# Sharing a report

To share a report with your colleagues in Teamleader Focus you have to follow these steps:

- Go to **Insights**

- Adapt a library report and **save **it or go to your **saved reports **in ‘By me’ and open a report:
![Navigation menu showing the Insights tab and My Reports options in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34800393506193)
 

- In the report, you click on the **arrow **next to ‘Copy link’ in the top right-hand corner and choose **Share with colleagues:**
**![Export and sharing options dropdown menu in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915986833)**

*Note**: **After clicking on this button your preference will be remembered, making this the default sharing option.*
* *

- Select the colleagues you want to share the report with. You can share a report with:

One colleague

- Multiple colleagues

- Everyone in the account
*! Note: *Every user will show up in the sharing dropdown irrespective if they have user access to Insights or not, no warning will be given.
 

- Click on **Invite**

- Now you can choose whether your colleague has **view-only** access to the report or if they can **edit **it.

![The 'Share with colleagues' dialog in Teamleader Focus for managing user access and permissions.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915988113)

Easily **remove access** by clicking on ‘Remove access’.

- 
**Copy link**: you can also copy a link to the report and send it to other people. Bear in mind that only people with access to the report and the correct user permissions will be able to access it via the link, otherwise you’ll receive an error message. Sharing a report externally is thus not possible, but you can always export the report to PDF and Excel.

![Access denied error message stating 'Sorry, you don't have access to this report'.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786882969745)
 

- Click on **Close**

- As owner of the report you’ll see at a glance who has access to which report via the icons next to it:![Interface for sharing a customised report with colleagues in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915989777)

In your ‘By me’ overview in Insights you can also easily find with whom you shared all your reports via the ‘Shared with’ column:![The 'By me' reports list in Teamleader Focus showing shared reports and favorites.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786882970513)
 

# Opening a report shared with you

When a colleague shared a report with you, you’ll receive an email saying ‘A report was shared with you’ with a link to it:
![Notification message in Teamleader Focus indicating a report has been shared by a colleague.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915991569)
 

You’ll also receive a notification in-app in Teamleader Focus with the message that new reports were shared with you. Click on it to access the report immediately.
 

![The Teamleader Focus notification center showing a new shared report notification.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915992593) 
 

Access all the reports shared with you via the ‘Shared with me’ tab in Insights.

- If you have edit access to a report then you can see the other receivers of the report

- If you only have view access to a report then you won’t be able to see the other receivers. You’ll also see the label ‘View only’. You’ll still be able to export the report or copy the link.
![Action buttons for a report including View only, Copy link, Restore, and Save as new report.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915993105)
 

# Access rights and losing access

- As mentioned, you can give a user **view-only access** to a report or **edit access**. If you gave everyone e.g. edit access to a report but only one specific user has view-only access, then it’s this **user-specific access that counts.**
** **

- When sharing a report with colleagues e.g. a report concerning profit margin on projects, and a certain colleague **doesn’t have access **to a functionality such as projects, then no warning is given that some users have insufficient access. Instead, the receiver receives a notification about the report but they won’t be able to open it and see an error page:
![Teamleader Focus 404 error page indicating a missing or deleted page.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786915994001)
 

- If a user **loses access to certain functionalities** afterwards then they will only keep access to the data in the report they still have permission to view.

- If you **yourself lose access to certain functionalities but you created the report**, then you’ll still be able to access it afterwards.
 

- If a report was shared with you but you have **no access to Insights**, then you’ll receive the message ‘Sorry, you don’t have permission to see this data’:![Permission denied error message: 'Sorry, you don't have permission to see this data.'](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786882974865)
 

- If you as a **report owner **gave edit rights to your colleagues, then they **can’t remove your edit access** as you remain the owner and will keep all access rights.

- Users with edit rights can **remove their own edit rights** after you gave them these rights. They’ll however receive a warning when doing so.
![A confirmation dialog for updating permissions in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34786882976785)
 

- Users with edit rights that are no report owners can also **change edit rights or remove** access rights of **other receivers.**

- If the **owner **of a report **gets deleted **in Teamleader Focus but shared their reports with others, then those reports remain accessible and can’t be deleted.
