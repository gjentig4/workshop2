# Formatting

Everyone with access to insights is able to apply formatting to their reports. This way, you can detect outliers and highlight relevant items by creating rules to format your data.

 

Note that whenever you apply formatting to a report this formatting will be visible to everyone else you share the report with. 

 

Follow these steps to apply formatting to a report:

- 
**Open **a report, e.g. the ‘Billability rate monthly’. This can be a library report or an own customised report, but make sure there’s relevant data in it.

- Click on **Formatting**

- Choose **+ Add formatting**

- Fill out a rule, e.g. ‘Billability rate is less than 50%’, if you want to track billability rate and identify the users who aren’t meeting the desired billable hours.

*Notes:*

Know that you can add multiple rules (with different colours for example) at the same time too; these rules are applied in sequence from top to bottom and can be rearranged.

- You can only apply formatting on numerical fields for now, and not on non-numerical ones.
 

- Choose to highlight a cell or row and pick a colour in which to highlight the values: ![Dropdown menu for selecting highlight options in a table with a color picker.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34788236293905)

- If you enable ‘Apply formatting on group level’, then only the group gets highlighted

- Click on **Save**

- Find the highlighted values in the table below the report:

- You can find your formatting rules back in ‘Formatting’ and edit them by clicking on the pencil or remove them by clicking on the cross.
 

# Use cases

Next to keeping track of the billability rate there are numerous scenarios in which applying formatting can prove useful:

- 
**Deal cycle time**: keep track of deals for which the cycle time was greater than X amount of days

- 
**Unpaid invoices per customer:** highlight values if the ‘amount due’ is higher than a certain amount to take action

- …
