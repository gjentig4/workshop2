# How To: Add formulas to your insights reports in Teamleader Focus

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)*! Note that you need to have the Advanced insights Booster to use this functionality. Read more about it *[*here*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34775080480913-FAQ-What-are-the-key-features-of-the-Advanced-insights-Booster)*.*
 

Via custom formulas in Insights, you can create new fields based on existing data using simple calculations. This lets you perform quick, tailored analyses—without ever leaving your report. Formulas help you build fully customisable metrics that save time and keep everything in context. Read all about it here.

 

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

 

# Who

Important to know is that not everyone can create formulas in Insights by default. Users need to be given explicit permission. Follow these steps to give permission: 

- Go to **Settings > Users**

- Click on **the name of a user**

- In 'Permissions' > ‘Insights’, enable the slider next to ‘Manage formula-based fields’. 
![User permission settings for the Insights module and formula-based fields in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/37466688620305)
 

Enabling this will allow users to create, edit or delete formula-based fields.

- Users without the rights to manage formula-based fields will be able to consult these formula-based fields on a report but not edit them.
 

# How

When you have the right permissions to add formulas, it’s time to start adding them to your report:

- 
**Open **a report

- Click on the **cogwheel **in the table view of your report in the top right-hand corner

- Choose + **Add formula![Customizing columns and adding formulas in Teamleader Focus Insights reports.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34788779550353)**
** **

- Give your formula a **name **and a **description**. The description you give will be visible when you hover on the field. Give it a clear and useful description so you don’t need to check the formula.

- Choose the **field type**. Here you choose how the formula needs to be visualised e.g. ‘Money’:

- Fill out a **formula.**

**Type @** to insert a field. You’ll receive a list of fields to choose from:![Dropdown menu showing time tracking variables for custom field formulas in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34788796103569)
 

- Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on fields.
Use the following characters for this +, -, * , /, ().
Note that it’s not possible to use functions like SUM or AVG here.
 

- Click on **Save**

- Add the column with the formula to your table via the **cogwheel **in the settings of your table > **enable the field**
**![Column selection menu in Teamleader Focus showing formula fields and invoice columns.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34789323287825)**

*Note: *the formula fields you saved are remembered per insights category (e.g. invoices) and can be applied to multiple reports within that category. So you don't need to recreate the formula field for each report. If you create it on e.g. one invoice report, it will be available on all invoice reports.
 

- You can always edit the formula later by clicking on the three dots next to the Formula name in the table > **Edit:**
**![Column options menu in a Teamleader Focus list view for a custom formula field.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/34788779555985)**
 

Examples of formulas could be:

- In financial reports: calculate the VAT amount by calculating the difference between the total including VAT and the total excluding VAT:

- In financial reports: see the difference between the amount of the quotation and the amount that was invoiced in Teamleader Focus

- In time tracking reports: calculate the difference between the billable time tracked and the non-billable time tracked

- … The possibilities are endless!
