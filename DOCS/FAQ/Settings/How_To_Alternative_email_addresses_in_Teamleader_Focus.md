Do you want to use more than one personal email address in your Teamleader Focus account? Then the alternative email addresses you can add via your personal profile are the solution for you! Discover how to add them in this article.

## Add alternative email address(es)

To add alternative email addresses, follow these steps:

- Click on your **user ****icon **in the top right-hand corner in Teamleader Focus

- Click on **My ****profile**

- Next to ‘Email addresses’, click on the **+ **to insert the email address(es).

- 
Give your email address a Name. This means that the sender appearing in the mailbox of your customer can be customised. 
You can always edit this name afterwards.

## Verify alternative email address(es)

Your primary email address (which is your current user email address) has to be unique. The other email addresses you add here don’t have to be unique; this means that multiple users could add the same email address in their accounts as an alternative email address. However, the email address needs to be **verified**** by each individual user:**

- An email with a link will be sent to the email address that was added

- To complete the verification, click on the link in the email. The link is valid for 72 hours. If you didn’t verify the email address on time:

Remove the email address from your ‘Alternative email addresses’ by clicking on the **trash ****bin **next to it

- Add the alternative email address again; the verification email will be sent again

- After clicking the link the user needs to log in to Teamleader Focus
*Note: If multiple users use the same alternative email address they each need to click on the link in the email and log in separately into Teamleader Focus.*

- The verification process is now completed. 
 

After verification, you can select this email address in the drop-down when sending meeting invites, emails and quotations.

You could also make one of the verified email addresses your primary email address (read more about this below).

 

## Set alternative email address as default outgoing

You are also able to indicate which of the alternative email addresses should be selected by **default **when sending emails from Teamleader Focus, so you don’t have to change the email address in the drop-down every time:

- Go to **My profile**

- In 'Email addresses', you'll see the label 'Outgoing' next to your email address

- Click on the **three ****dots **next to another one of your email addresses

- Choose **Make default outgoing**
**![Managing email addresses in Teamleader Focus settings, showing how to set a default outgoing email.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25697861733265)**
 

This is handy when you send email from a different email address than your personal one. For example when all users in your company want to send emails from the same mailbox (and the alternative email address is shared). 

 

Notes:

- Only email addresses that have been verified can be changed to the default outgoing email address

- The default outgoing email will be selected in the drop-down of the sender when sending emails except for items that are sent via the company entity email (like invoices, ..)

- Another alternative email address can always still be selected via the drop-down when sending your email

- Next to choosing (one of) your alternative email address(es) as sender, you can also choose the general email address of your [company entity](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) as sender. The signature linked to your chosen company entity will then be applied.

 

## Custom domains for outgoing emails

If you have multiple email addresses with a **different ****domain ****name**, then you need to set up separate custom domains. If you don’t do this, the email address of the sender will be ‘email@teamleader.be’. However;

- The name preview for the receiver of your email will still be the name you gave to the email address;

- The replies to these kind of emails will be sent to the primary email address of the sender

 

Setting up a custom domain happens on **account **level, not on user level. So if multiple users have ‘@teamleader.eu’ as an email address then the domain ‘teamleader’ only needs to be set up once.

## Choose other primary email address/change user email address

What if you want to choose another primary email address or change your current user email address? Then you need to follow these security steps:

- Go to 'Email addresses'

- Next to your primary email address, click on the three dots

- Click on **Change primary email address **and fill out another email address

- Confirm this email address via your email inbox following the steps described above

- Choose one of your alternative email addresses as the primary email address?
Click on the three dots next to the alternative email address and choose **Turn into primary. **However; it won't be possible to set a non-unique email address as primary address.
