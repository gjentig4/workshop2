Many companies like to add their general terms and conditions to their invoices and quotations. In Teamleader Focus you can do this automatically, so that you don’t have to keep adding them manually. This can be done in two ways:

 

1. Add standard general terms and conditions2. Add various terms and conditions

## 1. Add standard general terms and conditions  

Do you always apply the same general terms and conditions to all of your invoices and quotations? Then it’s simple. Teamleader Focus can automatically add your terms and conditions to your documents without you having to do anything extra. All you need to do is upload your terms and conditions. This is how you do it:

- Navigate to **Settings > Company information. **

- Click on your company entity. 

- Click on **T****erms and conditions**

- You'll be able to choose which type of conditions you add:

Default general conditions (applied to both quotations and invoices)

- General conditions exclusively for quotations

- General conditions exclusively for orders

- Click on the **+** to add them:

Be sure to select the right language for your terms and conditions. If you make an invoice for a non-English- speaking customer, the terms and conditions will immediately be sent in this language (if available).

Click **Upload file** to select the file on your computer and then click **Close**. And there you are: your terms and conditions are in Teamleader Focus! From now on they will be added to every invoice you send.NB: Do you want to add them to your quotations too? Then click ‘Deals and Quotations’, at the top in ‘Settings’, and select the option ‘Show defaults terms and conditions on quotations’.

## 2. Add different terms and conditions

If, however, you have different terms and conditions for different services in your company, it is better to use a different method for adding these. The best way is to [create several versions of your layout ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691627848977-FAQ-How-can-I-add-different-layout-variations-of-my-documents-e-g-quotations-or-invoices)in your house style in Word. Add each set of terms and conditions to a different version of the layout and upload the various versions again to Teamleader Focus. Then, when you create your invoice, you can choose which layout and consequently which terms and conditions you want to use.
