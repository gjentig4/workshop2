The answer is simple: yes, it’s possible in Teamleader Focus to set a bcc for all your outgoing email! Read all about it here.

 

When you or your colleagues are sending emails from within Teamleader Focus, it might be handy to be able to forward all your outgoing email to a bcc email address of your choice.

To set this up, you first of all need access to ‘Settings’. Then, follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings **> **Email > ****Preferences**![Email preferences in Teamleader Focus showing logo, thumbnail, and BCC options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693945588753)

- Click on **Add bcc for all outgoing email**

- Insert the email address and click on **Save**

 

Important to know is that this is an **account-wide feature**, so it’s not possible to set this up individually. The same email address will be used for the whole account. 

 

## Notes

This feature will ensure that **all **outgoing email will end up in the inbox of the email address you’ve chosen.
