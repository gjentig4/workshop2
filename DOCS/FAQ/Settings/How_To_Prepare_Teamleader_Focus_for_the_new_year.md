# How To: Prepare Teamleader Focus for the new year

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691728812945)

 

To a lot of us, a new calendar year also means preparations for the new year or means the start of a new fiscal year. Luckily, Teamleader Focus comes well prepared so you have to do as little as possible. Should you still be somewhat uncertain about what needs to happen by the end of the fourth quarter, we've compiled a practical little Q&A especially for you.

 

Would you rather learn all about this by watching a video? Go ahead:

 

# Invoicing & accounting

 

- For B2B invoices in Belgium, e-invoicing will become mandatory from 01/01/2026 onwards. How do I enable Peppol in Teamleader Focus?

- Do I need to create my own fiscal year for 2026?

- Will my numbering of invoices start anew from 1? And the numbering of the deals? And the numbering of all the other documents?

- What about credit notes?

- Can I still book invoices for the previous fiscal year?

- My Teamleader Focus is linked to accounting software. Do I need to make changes?

- The synchronisation of my invoices to my accounting software failed and I don't know why?

 

***Q: For B2B invoices in Belgium, e-invoicing will become mandatory from 01/01/2026 onwards. How do I enable Peppol in Teamleader Focus?***

**A:** E-invoicing is set to become mandatory in all European countries by 2030. For Belgium, the deadline for e-invoicing is 01/01/2026. [This article covers the essentials of e-invoicing and Peppol, and provides a step-by-step process to enable Peppol in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-e-invoicing-and-how-do-I-enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

***Q: Do I need to create my own fiscal year for 2026?***

**A:** No. If your fiscal year coincides with the calendar year, then Teamleader Focus automatically generates a new fiscal year together with your first invoice of 2026. If you use one of our many accounting integrations, then by default the same journals as the former fiscal year are adopted.

 

Besides, this is not exclusive to fiscal years that coincide with the calendar year. Say your fiscal year ends on March 31st and you create a new invoice on April 1st, then Teamleader Focus will likewise automatically generate a new fiscal year.

If you use subscriptions to generate invoices, we strongly recommend you do create your own fiscal year upfront so that you can choose the numbering of your invoices yourself. Otherwise the first invoice will start with default nr 1.

Create your own fiscal year by going to **Settings **> **Revenue **> **Fiscal ****years** > Button **+**. If you do this, Teamleader Focus won't automatically generate a new fiscal year anymore. Creating your own fiscal years is advised if you want to define [your own invoice numbering](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691346944657-FAQ-Can-I-choose-the-numbering-of-my-invoices-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

***Q: ******Will my numbering of invoices start anew from 1?***

**A:** Exactly. If you don't set up your own numbering, the numbering of your invoices starts again from the very first invoice of the new fiscal year. Its prefix will also be the name of the fiscal year. In the fiscal year 2026, that makes for a first invoice numbered as 2026/1.
 

***Q: And the numbering of the deals?***

**A:** No, the numbering of the deals will continue from the previous years.

 

***Q: And the numbering of all the other documents?***

**A: **No, if you want us to change your numbering, [we explain it in this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692655031057-FAQ-What-are-the-possibilities-regarding-document-renumbering). Please read it carefully and follow the instructions.

 

***Q: What about credit notes?***

**A:** Same principle. The numbering of credit notes is also reset to start from 1 again. As you know, this numbering is independent from the invoice numbering.

***Q: Can I still book invoices for the previous fiscal year?*** 

**A:** Sure, you can always book invoices for the previous fiscal year. Just make sure you mind the date. Say your (provisional) last invoice of the fiscal year was dated December 20th, then it's still possible to add invoices dating from the 20th up to and including the 31st of December. Was your last invoice dated December 31st? Then you can create invoices for this date only.

***Q: My Teamleader Focus is linked to accounting software. Do I need to make changes?***
**A:** Most types of accounting software automatically generate a new fiscal year with the passing of the last one. Give it a check just to make sure, though.

 

***Q: The synchronisation of my invoices to my accounting software failed and I don't know why?***

**A**: To know what went wrong exactly you can check if you've received an error message. Navigate to your invoices and click on the double arrows in the top right-hand corner to manually sync with your accounting software. You'll receive a notification via the bell icon:

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691712765585)

The error message will tell you where the sync goes wrong or will tell you to [contact us](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065). Please let us know which error notification you receive exactly. It can also help to add the column 'Bookkeeping number' to your invoices overview by clicking on the cogwheel in the bottom right corner. The first invoice that can't be synchronised, is the invoice without a bookkeeping number. The problem is probably related to this invoice.

 

# Products

- How can I carry out an indexation of my product prices?

- I increased my product prices, what will happen to my subscriptions?

 

***Q: How can I carry out an indexation of my product prices?***

**A**: First you need to export your products, adapt the price in Excel and import the file in Teamleader Focus. Read [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693930507281-How-To-Indexation-in-Teamleader-Focus) to learn how. If you want to use the current prices in Teamleader Focus and only charge the price increase for certain customers, you can work with price lists. You can find [more information in this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691973505809-How-To-Create-price-lists). 
As for subscriptions, there's also a possibility to update the product prices of existing subscriptions in bulk. [Read more.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693930507281-How-To-Indexation-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

***Q: I increased my product prices, what will happen to my subscriptions?***

**A**: The prices of the products in your subscription won't update automatically. You'll need to navigate to the subscription in question, edit the price(s) of the article and save the subscription again. The invoices generated afterwards will have the updated prices.

 

# User settings

- Some former employees will be replaced by new colleagues at the beginning of the year. What steps should I take?

- Do I need to create new vacation types at the beginning of the year?

- How can I see an overview of the leave my employees took this year?

 

***Q: Some former employees will be replaced by new colleagues at the beginning of the year. What steps should I take?***
**A: **Deactivate the user account of the former colleague. This will open up a slot to create a new account and have the colleague start off with a clean slate. [More information can be found in this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693018842513-How-To-Replacing-one-user-by-another).

 

***Q: Do I need to create new ***[***vacation types***](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690696602897-How-To-Configuring-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus)*** at the beginning of the year? ***
**A: **Yes. We strongly advise you to do this instead of extending the validation date. Reusing the same vacation type may lead to errors. For example, the holidays of the previous year could disappear and this would cause them to be added up in the recorded leave of the new year.

 

***Q:  How can I see an overview of the leave my employees took this year?***

**A: **Navigate to **Settings **> **Holiday management **> Click on the three dots next to “Closing Days” > Click on 'Export'. 

 

# [Invoice unbilled time](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691017896081-How-To-Invoicing-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

***Q: How can I invoice the remaining unbilled time for my customer(s) in 2025? ***

**A: **Navigate to **Revenue **> **Invoices > Invoice unbilled time. **You can also click on the advanced options to only invoice time tracking before or on a certain date. 

 

# Lead capture Booster

***Q: How do I handle holidays in the scheduling module of the Lead capture Booster?***

A: There are two options to register your holidays in the scheduling module of the Lead capture Booster.

- Put your holiday period in the external calendar:
[If you've connected the Lead capture Booster with an external calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695106112785-How-To-Scheduling-in-the-Lead-capture-Booster#Connect-your-calendar), then you can set up your holiday period in that calendar. Make sure that the events in your external calendar have the status 'Busy' instead of 'Free'. Then those time slots will be blocked from your availability, and clients won't be able to book a meeting during your 'busy' time slots.

- Adjust the availability of you and your colleagues in the meeting types of the Lead capture booster. [Read all about it here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694676285969-How-To-Create-a-team-meeting-type-as-an-admin#2.3-Availability)

 

 

Maybe it's a bit early, but happy New Year anyway!
