# FAQ: Can you make fields required in Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

In Teamleader Focus, there is a distinction between standard fields and custom fields that you create yourself. Whereas standard fields cannot be made mandatory, it is no problem for custom fields.

- Go to "**Settings**" > "**Custom fields**"

- Create or edit a custom field.

- Click on "**Advanced options**"

- Put the slider next to "Required field" on "**Yes**"

- From now on the field needs to be filled in before the item, e.g. contact, invoice, etc. can be saved.
