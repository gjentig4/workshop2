# FAQ: Can I deactivate a company entity?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25694887195281)

 

If you have [multiple company entities](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) in Teamleader Focus, you might want to reorganise them from time to time. If you want to archive a company entity without permanently deleting it, it’s possible to deactivate it. Follow the steps in this article to deactivate a company entity.

 

- Go to **Settings **> Company information

- Click on the **three ****dots **next to your company entity

- Choose **Deactivate**

When you deactivate a company entity it will no longer be available to be used in Teamleader Focus. It will still be visible on linked items though, such as quotations, invoices, etc.

 

You can always reactivate the company entity at a later point in time. Go to the tab 'Deactivated', click on the **three ****dots **next to it and choose **Activate**:

## Subscriptions

When you have active subscriptions linked to your company entity, note that these subscriptions will be **permanently **deactivated. It won’t be possible to reactivate them anymore even after activating the company entity again.

 

## Deleting a company entity

As opposed to deactivating a company entity, deleting it will be completely permanent. You won’t be able to use or retrieve the company entity anymore.
