Do you have another email address you want to link to your Teamleader Focus account as the primary login email address? Read this article to learn which steps to follow.

You need to follow these security steps:

  - 
    
      Go to your **user ****icon **in
      the top right-hand corner
    

  

  - 
    
      Click on **My ****profile**
    

  

  - 
    
      Click on **the three dots **next
      to your email address and choose
      **Change primary email address**
    

  

  - 
    
      Fill out the email address and click on 'Change primary email address'.
      Keep in mind: it’s not possible to set an email address that is already
      in use for another active user or Teamleader Focus account as the primary
      address.
    

  

  - 
    
      Open the email you’ve received in your inbox. Click on the link to confirm
      your email address and then you're all set!

      If you've already added alternative email addresses, you can choose one
      of these as your primary email address. This way, you don’t need to go
      through the verification flow.
