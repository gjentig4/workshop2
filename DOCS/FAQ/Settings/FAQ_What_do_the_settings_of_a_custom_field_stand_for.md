# FAQ: What do the settings of a custom field stand for?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692057401617)

 

Custom fields offer a way to personalize Teamleader Focus. We offer several standard fields in each module, but we know that processes can differ for everyone, and that different information may be important to every company. This is why we created custom fields, that allow you to implement your very own way of working in Teamleader Focus.

 

A general overview of how custom fields are created can be found [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

Before you start creating custom fields, you should start by bundling all information you urgently need and specify on which level you need them. For example, it doesn't make much sense to create all custom fields on CRM level, simply to have all information with the company or the contact. That will just make it more difficult to keep an overview, and you cannot make use of the entire idea behind custom fields.

 

Next to adding crucial information, another important part about custom fields is that you can create [segments ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)based on those fields. This is why it is even more interesting to have a look at the following article.

 

In order to create a custom field, simply navigate to **Settings > Custom fields > +**.

You then need to fill in several values.

 

## 1. Name

Name: Give the custom field a name that is easily recognizable for you and your colleagues. You can also change this name afterwards by going to Settings > Custom fields > Pencil next to the custom field.

 

## 2. Type

Type: The type of a custom field is essential, and cannot be changed once it has been chosen. Therefore, it is wise to really think thoroughly about what you want to achieve with a custom field. Also, the type will influence the segmentation options that you'll have.

 

### Single line text

An empty field is created which you can fill in as you wish.

 

### Multiline text

- A white field is created, allowing you to add more extensive information. This field can only be created on CRM level, which means on contact or company level.
*Note: *on deal level, you could use [the 'Remarks' field](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) to function as a custom field type multiline text.

- It will look like this:

- You cannot segment on this type of custom field.
 

### Single selection

- A dropdown menu is created with all the options you fill in.

- You can fill in the options when creating the custom field or later when you edit it.

- When filling in the custom field, you also have the option to click on “other” to insert an additional option right away.
 

### Multiple selection

- A dropdown menu will be created with all the options you have created.

- You can add options when you create the custom field or when you edit it at a later stage.

- You can choose several options at the same time.

### Date

When filling in a custom field of this type, a calendar will be opened, allowing you to easily select a date.

 

### Money

This custom field allows you to fill in an amount of money. The currency selected will be the standard currency of your account.

 

### Integer

With this field, an empty field is created. You can only fill in integer numbers.

 

### Number

Here you can fill in any type of number. Note that it doesn't have to be a whole number, it could also contain a comma.

 

### Automatically incrementing field

This field allows you to fill in a start value (needs to be a natural number). The following item will automatically be linked to a subsequent number. A typical example for this field is customer numbers. First, create a custom field on company level and fill in your start value. From then on, every newly created company automatically will be linked to a number, +1 to the previous one.

 

### Yes/No

A slider will be created which you can set on “Yes” or “No”. By default, it it set to “No” and has to be set on “Yes” if applicable.

 

### Email address

Filling in an email address in this type of field allows you to send an email from Teamleader Focus. A pop-up will appear when you click on this email address.

 

### Phone number

Typing a phone number into this field allows you to click on it, in order to start a call in case you work with one of our VOIP integrations.

 

### URL

### Company

### Contact

## 3. For

### Meeting report

After a meeting has taken place, you can choose to add a meeting report, and add additional information. This could be used for example to declare whether this meeting was successful or to indicate whether further actions need to be taken and by whom.

 

### Meeting

The meeting itself can also be personalized. You could add the customer's name in the first pop-up, for example.

 

### Task

You want to add some more information to a task? Feel free to do so via the custom fields.

 

### Call

In addition to adding information to meetings and tasks, you can also choose to add more details to calls. You can also filter on this information in the calendar module or export the information.

 

### Product

You can use custom fields to add additional product information. Custom fields are also frequently used [to add item descriptions in different languages](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690897267601-How-To-Translating-product-descriptions-for-quotations-and-invoices-in-Teamleader-Focus).

It's not possible to create custom fields for quotations.

 

### Invoice

- Custom fields on invoice level can also be used to add a bank transaction number to your invoice.

### Subscription

You can also add more information to subscriptions. For example, many people choose to create an overview of the kind of subscriptions they offer.

 

### Orders

- Note that orders are not activated by default in Teamleader Focus. You can, however, [activate them by sending us an email](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/requests/new?ticket_form_id=25911134514065).

- This option is used very often to add more information about suppliers.

 

### [Work orders](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690927285777-How-To-From-work-order-to-invoice)

Every process is different, and if your work order contains crucial information, then custom fields are the way to go.

 

 

 

### Ticket ([Boost ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693667750929-Our-BOOST-package)or [Shared inbox](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW#:~:text=of%20a%20project-,Shared%20inbox,-Time%20to%20introduce))

A custom field on ticket level may help you keep an overview of ticket types. If you filter on this type of field, you'll see for example what most tickets are about (what the most common issues are).

 

## 4. Advanced options

Under advanced options, you see different values depending on the type you choose.

 

### Group

This option will always be available. The idea behind it is to create an even more advanced overview. If you create several custom fields and some are related to each other, you can create a group so they appear together under one header. Of course, you can name the group according to your process. It will then be displayed as shown below:

### Required

You can mark fields as required, which means that they have to be filled in, otherwise you cannot save the contact, the company or the deal, depending on where you create the custom field.

 

### Searchable

This means that you can search for the content of this custom field via the search field you find at the top of the overview of every module. With this option, there is a limit of three, meaning that you can make up to three fields searchable. Because of this, you'll have to define which content is most important to search on for you, personally. Of course, you'll always have the option to create segments based on custom fields. This in turn will also provide you with an overview of all contacts or companies containing this custom field.
