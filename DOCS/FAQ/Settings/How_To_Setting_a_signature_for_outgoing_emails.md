Give your email an extra touch with a signature. 

Keep in mind that this is a general **signature for your whole company**. So do not include any personal information such as your name and personal telephone number because all emails of your company will include this signature, those of your employees too.

Do you prefer to watch our instructive video first? You can do so right here:

Follow these steps:

- Navigate to “**Settings**” and choose “**Email**”

- Go to “Signatures for outgoing email” and click on the **pencil** next to your company.

- Choose “**HTML email**” in the dropdown menu

- Make a signature as shown below![The email signature editor in Teamleader Focus with an HTML rich text toolbar.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690735144465)

- Type “#TEAMLEADER_CONTENT” where the actual content of your email is to go. Usually this will be immediately above the signature, as is also the case in the image above.

If you want to upload a picture with the full signature or a logo, you need to follow these steps:

- Click on the **i****mage** icon on the bar just above the big blank space

- Go to the tab called "**Upload**"

- Click on "**Select file" **Note: only images with .jpg extensions are accepted

- Once selected, click on "**Send it to the server**"

- If everything went fine, you will have received a message like this:![A success message dialog stating 'The upload was successful' with a green checkmark icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690741633937)

- Adjust the size of the image and whenever ready, click on** OK***Note*: We advise you to already change the size of the image to the correct size before uploading it, especially if you're using Outlook Desktop, to make sure the image will always be shown in the correct size. 

6. Click on “**Save**” to save the email signature
