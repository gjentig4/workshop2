Yes, if you work with [multiple company entities in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus), you can set a default company entity. 

 

To do this, follow these steps:

- Go to **Settings > Company information**

- Click on the **three dots **next to the company entity you'd like to set as default company entity

- Click on **Set as default**
**![Action menu for Peppol settings in Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/39923728537233)**
 

This will cause this company entity to be the default one, and therefore the one used by default when creating invoices, quotations or when using a signature when sending an email. Remember that even if this is marked as default, you can continue to manually select the other company entities when necessary.
