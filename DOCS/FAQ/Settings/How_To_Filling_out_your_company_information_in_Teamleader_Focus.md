## Company address

Fill out all relevant information concerning your company address right here in this tab.

 

## Payment information

The payment information you insert in these fields gets used in Teamleader Focus for your invoices. Think of your bank information, but also any [interest or late fees](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691540229137-How-To-Interest-and-late-fees) you want to apply to your invoices.

 

*Note: *If changes to your company details, company address, or payment information aren’t reflected on your documents (such as quotations or invoices), try saving the document again or creating a new one to see if the updated information appears. [Read more about e.g. editing your invoice at the end of this article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691148276241-How-To-How-can-I-edit-my-invoice) If the details still don’t update, they are likely added as fixed text in your document template.
