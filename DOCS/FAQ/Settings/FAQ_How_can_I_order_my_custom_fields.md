# FAQ: How can I order my custom fields?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)

By default, the custom fields within one part are ordered alphabetically. However, in case you would want to set up a certain order, then Teamleader Focus offers two options to do so.

## Groups

- Go to "**Settings**" > "**Custom fields**".

- Click on the **pencil** next to a custom field.

- Click on "Advanced options".

- There you have the option to add a custom field to an existing group or create a new group.
*Note: A custom field of the type Multiline text won't be shown in a group.*

- Custom fields of one group are not shown in one long list but will be separated into the different groups. The order within the group is again alphabetically.

#### Deleting a group

Follow these steps to delete a group later on:

- Edit the custom fields belonging to the group one by one by clicking on the **Advanced options**

- Change the group of the custom field(s) to another group

- When there are no more custom fields assigned to the group you want to delete, the group gets automatically deleted.

## Numbering custom fields

- Go to "**Settings**" > "**Custom fields**".

- Click on the **pencil** next to a custom field.

- Edit the name of the field you would like to see on top of the list, e.g. the field is called "Test", rename it to "1. Test"

- Use the same system with the other custom fields until you have the desired order.
