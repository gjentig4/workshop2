# FAQ: Can I change how dates are displayed within Teamleader Focus?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089) 

If you have [multiple entities](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) or colleagues in your account that are located in countries using different date formats, chances are that users could easily get confused by the account date format as it might differ from what they are used to. Read here how each user can personalise how dates are displayed throughout the account.

 

In Teamleader Focus, [there’s a setting that allows you to specify the date format used on outgoing documents.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693633724049-FAQ-Can-I-set-a-different-date-format-on-documents) This doesn’t influence **how dates are displayed throughout Teamleader Focus** however.

 

Follow these steps to change the date format in the UI. Note that each user has to follow these steps individually:

- Click on your **profile ****icon **in the top right-hand corner in Teamleader Focus

- Click on **My ****profile**

- Below ‘Details’, you can find ‘Date format’:
![User profile details showing language and date format selection in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25696234342033)

- Select the date format out of this fixed list:

dd/mm/yyyy

- mm/dd/yyyy

- dd-mm-yyyy

- dd.mm.yyyy

- After the new format is set:

All dates visible in the UI of the account are converted to the new format.

- Date formats on documents and exports won’t be changed as this is [another setting.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693633724049-FAQ-Can-I-set-a-different-date-format-on-documents)
