When you work with customers all around the world, you might want to adapt the date format of your documents to fit theirs. It’s possible to set a different date format per [company entity](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697681388177-How-To-Multiple-company-entities-in-Teamleader-Focus) in Teamleader Focus, allowing you to optimise the outgoing communications towards your customers. Find out how to set a specific date format in this article.

## How

To change the date format of your company entity, follow these steps:

- 
Go to **Settings **> **Company ****information **> **click** on the company entity you want to edit > **Edit**

- 
Click on **Company details**

- 
Choose your date format in the field **Date ****format**

The options are:![The 'Fill in company information' setup wizard showing company details and date format options.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25693639186321)

- 
dd/mm/yyyy

- 
mm/dd/yyyy 

- 
dd-mm-yyyy

- 
dd.mm.yyyy

## What

The date format you set for your company entity is applied to:

- 
Quotations

- 
Time Tracking Reports

- 
Order Confirmations

- 
Work orders

- 
Delivery notes

- 
Orders

- 
Invoices

- 
Credit notes

- 
“Date” Custom Field 

 

*Notes*:

- 
It’s not possible to set a date format for a specific document as a date format is assigned to a specific company entity and is always applied to **all **documents of that entity.

- 
Don’t forget to add the date as a **shortcode **on your documents if you want the date to appear. Read more about customising your templates [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692647207057-How-To-Customizing-your-templates-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

## No date format set

If you didn’t set a date format for your company entity, then all outgoing documents will show the date format dd/mm/yyyy unless you are sending a document to a customer based in one of the countries mentioned in the list below. Then the date format will be dd.mm.yyyy:

- CH: Switzerland

- DE: Germany

- PL: Poland

- AT: Austria

- CZ: Czech Republic

- EE: Estonia

- IS: Iceland

- ME: Montenegro

- RO: Romania

- RU: Russia

- RS: Serbia

- SK: Slovakia

- SI: Slovenia

- TR: Turkey

- UA: Ukraine

 

## User-specific date formats

The date format chosen in your company entity settings doesn’t influence how dates are displayed throughout the complete account itself (in the UI). Each user can change this in their settings as we want to individually allow users to personalise how dates are shown.
