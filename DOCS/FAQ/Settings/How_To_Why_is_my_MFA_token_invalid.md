# How To: Why is my MFA token invalid?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/26755126764049)

At Teamleader Focus, your security is important to us. That's why we've implemented [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692015506577-How-To-Set-up-MFA-security) to ensure your account remains secure. However, we know that despite how simple it *seems* to enter the MFA token, its validation is very strict, which can lead to unexpected issues. If you encounter an "**Invalid token**" error during your login or MFA set-up, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.

# Common causes

## 1. Check the "Date & Time" settings on your mobile device 

Ensure that the time on your smartphone or tablet is 100% accurate. MFA tokens are very time-sensitive, and an incorrect time setting will cause the token to be considered "invalid".

- 

On iOS: Go to **Settings > General > Date & Time** and enable **Set Automatically**.

- On Android: Go to **Settings > System > Date & Time** and enable **Automatic date & time**.

## 2. Synchronise the time in your authenticator app

- For some authenticator apps on Android, you can synchronise the time within the app.

- In Google Authenticator on Android: Open the app, go to **Settings > Time correction for codes > Sync now**.

- For iOS devices, this option is generally not available. Instead, make sure your device's time is set to automatic.

## 3. Verify you’re using the correct token

- Ensure you're entering the token from the **correct account** if you have multiple accounts set up in your authenticator app.

## 4. Refresh the token

- If the token is about to expire (after 30 seconds), **wait for the next one** and try entering it again.

## 5. Make sure your authenticator app is up to date

- 
Visit the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android) to **check for updates**.

# Alternative methods

If you still experience issues, you can use one of the fallback options. We can send you a one-time code via email or SMS. Follow these steps:

- In the MFA widget, choose **“Use a different method”** or **“I can’t access my authenticator app”**.

- Choose to receive a one-time code via email or SMS.

- Enter the one-time code sent to your email or phone.
