# Teamleader Focus for Construction, Manufacturing or Installation

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692850503441)

 

Anyone active in construction, manufacturing or installation wants to do what they do best; whether it be carpenting, plumbing, tiling or roofing; the point is to get the job done, and spending as little time as needed on planning and administration is part of that. This is where Teamleader Focus comes in. This article explores a potential workflow using Teamleader Focus in the construction, manufacturing or installation business. 

 

Needless to say, no two companies are the same and these are just suggestions. Teamleader Focus offers multiple options for every action.

## Lead capture Booster

Running a business without online meetings is hard to imagine in this day and age. That’s why we have our Lead capture Booster in Teamleader Focus. Schedule, meet and engage with customers online, on top of all the other functionality our tool already brings. [Read all about what it is and how to activate it.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster)

## Time tracking

*(Not available in our old *[*GO package*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)*)*

 

[Time tracking ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)allows you to register all hours spent on your meetings, tasks or calls. Click the link to find out about the different ways in which to track time. Here is how you might do it:

 

When a task has been finished:

 

1. Go to the '**Calendar module'** and click the task.

2. Click '**Mark as done**'. (*It's also possible to track time immediately without finishing the task) *
3. Click on '**Add**** time tracking**'

4. Indicate the start and finish time.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692880355601)

5. Indicate whether or not the task is billable. If you select this, the time tracking will be registered as ‘unbilled time’ and can be added to the invoice later on.

 

## Work Order

 

Teamleader Focus' [Work order module](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690927285777-How-To-From-work-order-to-invoice) will allow you to create a work sheet and have it signed by the customer on location. This is where the mobile app comes in. If you haven’t already downloaded it, you can do so via the Apple App Store for your IPhone or via Google Play if you’re an Android user.

 

To create a work order:

 

1. Open the Teamleader Focus app.

2. Click the 'plus' symbol at the bottom of your screen and select '**Work order**'.

3. You will now be asked to fill in all necessary info in order to complete the work order.

4. Fill in:

- The customer 

- The working hours (start and end time)

- The description of the work

- Products needed on the job (optional)

- Comments or images (optional)

5. The work order is now ready to be signed by the customer!

6. Click ‘**Save**’.

 

You will find the signed work order in the web version of Teamleader Focus in the menu **Work orders**, or** **under the tab ‘**Files**’ on the customer's page.

 

## Invoicing

All the tasks you have completed for the customer which you marked as ‘billable’, as well as the time tracked on the work order will appear under the ‘Unbilled time’ window on the customer's page in the CRM.

 

**![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692819289873)**

 

 

Click ‘**Actions**’ - ‘**Create invoice**’ to invoice all these items. Uncheck the box to the right of the items you do not want to include in the invoice.

 

This will generate a draft invoice, which you can immediately book and send.
