## CRM

 

### 
    Segmenting
  

 

Your CRM is the heart and soul of your business. In order to keep track of all your leads, customers and other contacts, you can use tags and custom fields to divide them into [segments](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus). What exactly are these?

 

### 
    Tags
  

 

[Tags](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690854640529-How-To-Using-tags-in-Teamleader-Focus) are specific bits of information you can assign to a contact or a company.

For instance, you might add tags like ‘tenant’, ‘property owner’, ‘supplier’ or ‘concierge’.

 

### 
    Custom fields
  

 

[Custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus) allow for a more specific categorisation. There are many types of custom fields that can correspond to the type of information you need. You could create a drop-down list, an extra URL field for hyperlinks, a simple slider, etc.

 

Here’s some examples:

- Let’s say you need to add information to contacts about their personal needs for a home. You could create a custom field of the type ‘single selection’ for ‘special assistance’. This will create a drop-down list which could contain ‘needs elevator’ or ‘needs spacious bathroom’, for example. 
 

- On a company level, you could add a custom field you name ‘Budget’ of the type ‘Money’. When you add a new company, or change an existing one, you can indicate the budget of the customers.

 

Once you’re able to add this extra information to contacts and companies, it will be much easier to segment them. This, in turn, will not only be interesting towards following up on all your actions, but also for mailings with one of our integrations for e-mail marketing like [Mailchimp ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690774879889-How-To-Sending-email-campaigns-with-Mailchimp-in-Teamleader-Focus)or [Campaign Monitor](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690737500305-How-To-Sending-email-campaign-with-Campaign-Monitor-in-Teamleader-Focus).

### 
    Related companies
  

 

If tenants are linked to a company in your CRM, just link them by clicking the three dots on top of the contact page of the tenant and click ‘Link to company’.

## Calendar

 

### 
    Calendar integration
  

 

If you’re already using a planning tool like Google Calendar, Outlook or iCloud, you can [integrate ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690957593745-How-To-Integrate-calendars-with-Teamleader-Focus)it with your Teamleader Focus planning. Every item you schedule in either agenda will then be synchronised both ways.

 

### 
    Scheduling meetings
  

 

Schedule meetings in Teamleader Focus by:

 

- Simply dragging and dropping the preferred time slot in your calendar.

- You will be asked whether you want to schedule a task or a meeting.

- Select ‘Meeting’.

- Fill in a customer, a title, a date and a location.

- When the meeting is created, you can add contacts by clicking the plus sign next to ‘Contacts attending’.

If you have multiple meetings on the same day, Teamleader Focus can also [show you the route](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692375873553-Getting-started-How-do-you-want-to-structure-your-calendar) you need to take from one to another. This way you will never get lost between meetings!

## Lead capture Booster

Running a business without online meetings is hard to imagine in this day and age. That’s why we have our Lead capture Booster in Teamleader Focus. Schedule, meet and engage with customers online, on top of all the other functionality our tool already brings. [Read all about what it is and how to activate it.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster)

 

## Deals

 

### 
    Possible funnel
  

 

If your agency has several services or has different teams or company entities, you can [define different sales pipelines](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus) that match your specific methods. By default, the deal phase ‘Accepted’ is the end of each pipeline in Teamleader Focus. This means a lead has accepted your offer and is now a customer. You can always [adapt these phases](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691597918737-How-To-Managing-deal-phases) according to your own workflow. What phases do your leads usually go through before they become customers? Do you meet up with them 2 or 3 times before sending a quotation? Just add phases for First meeting and Second meeting, for example.

 

Personalise your phases via **Settings **> **Deals and Quotations **> Pipelines **> Add phase **or edit the phases

## Documents

 

The exchanging of documents and images are an important part of the real estate business. 

 

To add documents to a contact or company just click the ‘Files’ button in the lower right-hand corner of the page. A banner will appear on your screen containing all documents linked to the customer. Subdivide them into categories by creating maps. Click the folder sign to do so.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692966687249)

 

If your volume of documents to be exchanged is very large, you may want to check out our [Dropbox integration](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692160411409-How-To-How-do-I-link-Dropbox-to-Teamleader-Focus), which will allow a more efficient way of uploading documents.

 

## Web2Lead

 

A contact form on your website is a valuable tool that facilitates effective communication between your business and your audience. It serves as a convenient and user-friendly means for visitors to reach out to you or provide feedback. [Read everything about what contact forms are and how to set them up in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695775141649-How-To-Contact-forms-and-how-to-create-them)

 

Teamleader Focus also offers several [Web2Lead integrations](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/eu/en/category/web2lead). These allow you to link an online form directly to your CRM. Prospects finding their way to one of your landing pages can fill in a form and as soon as they submit, the contact is saved in Teamleader Focus. You can even choose to automatically create a deal!
