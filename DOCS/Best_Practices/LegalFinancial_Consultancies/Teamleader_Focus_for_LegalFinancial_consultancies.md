These are, of course, suggestions.

## Companies and Contacts

On every company and contact page you have access to all the information of your customers: 

- Contact info

- Extra info that you or your colleagues might have entered (ie. [custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus) about special needs, size of the customer etc...)

- Tracked [activity](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- Incoming or outgoing [emails ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692591287697-How-To-Tracking-emails-to-Teamleader-Focus)tracked to Teamleader Focus

- Info about the [deals](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692361765777-Getting-started-What-is-a-deal)

 

*Pro-tip: involving colleagues*

If you would like to notify a colleague and ask them a question, you can by entering the @ symbol in the notifications box in the bottom of the page. You will be able to select the name of one of your colleagues, who will receive a notification with your message.

 

### 
    Documents
  

You can upload files (contracts, legal information, DPA’s etc…) to the pages of all your contacts or companies. Do so via the ‘**Files**’ widget in the bottom-right corner of the page. Sync documents with your [Dropbox](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692160411409-How-To-How-do-I-link-Dropbox-to-Teamleader-Focus) team account to share files among your colleagues.

 

## Lead capture Booster

Running a business without online meetings is hard to imagine in this day and age. That’s why we have our Lead capture Booster in Teamleader Focus. Schedule, meet and engage with customers online, on top of all the other functionality our tool already brings. [Read all about what it is and how to activate it](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster).

 

## Agenda and Timesheets

Your [agenda](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692375873553-Getting-started-How-do-you-want-to-structure-your-calendar) obviously allows you to add tasks, calls & meetings, and let's you know what meetings and tasks you have already scheduled.

 

### 
    Agenda integration
  

If you already use an [external agenda](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690957593745-How-To-Integrate-calendars-with-Teamleader-Focus) like Google Calendar, Outlook or ICloud, be sure to integrate it in you Teamleader Focus account. Items scheduled in Teamleader Focus or the external agenda will be synchronised to the other tool so you never have to miss out on a meeting again.

    *[](https://support.focus.prd.teamleader.eu/hc/en-us/articles/25693707105297)*
  

 

### 
    Export timesheets
  

*(feature not available in our old *[*GO package*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)*)*

 

In Teamleader Focus you can also [track time](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692448113041-Getting-started-How-can-you-track-time). After you've planned your schedule and finished an item, you can just click through via the agenda and mark it as finished.

If needed, you can also [export](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691186210961-How-To-Create-an-Excel-export-in-Teamleader-Focus) all tracked time via the Timesheets module to get a better overview of what you or your colleagues worked on and when. [Read this article to learn more about this](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691716494225-How-To-Exporting-reports-from-Teamleader-Focus).

 

Next, you will find out how these tasks and meetings are related to the projects in Teamleader Focus.

 

## Projects

 

### 
    Work breakdown
  

The project module is the module you will eventually use most, as you probably provide a long term service to your customers. A project can be created when you engage in a long-term relation with a customer that requires a layered set-up of the tasks you perform for them involving multiple colleagues. [Planning groups will help you divide the project into different parts. Under these, you can add tasks, materials and meetings and assign them to colleagues.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695560896145-How-To-Add-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus) This way, it should always be clear what is being worked on by whom and when. When all tasks and meetings are done, be sure to close the project.  

 

*Pro-tip: *[*duplicate a project*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695832552593-How-To-Duplicate-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus)

If your projects have a recurring structure, you can work with project duplication to avoid having to create the same groups and tasks over and over again.

 

### 
    Project info
  

In a project the project info provides you with:

- An overview of **budget spent **(the amount of billable hours and materials). Budget management on projects is a way to keep track of the predetermined budget you and your customer have agreed upon. By allocating resources and estimating time on billable tasks, materials and meetings, you'll know if you are going over budget.

- 
**Margin**: Keep track of your costs and potential revenue via the Margin feature in every project. Take a look at your costs, so you can tweak where needed.
 

 

### 
    Projects timeline
  

From your project list overview, you can easily switch to [the projects timeline](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696110215441-How-To-The-timeline-view-in-projects). It provides you with a visual timeline overview of all your projects. It lets you continuously evaluate how occupied your business is and shows you which projects need your attention.

 

### 
    User access to projects
  

It's possible not all Teamleader Focus users in your account need to have the same access rights to projects. You can [choose the type of access](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695680166801-FAQ-What-are-the-different-rights-in-a-project) you want to give each user to projects.

 

## Planning

Once you have created the project with all the tasks that need to be done, it is time to start planning them. Teamleader Focus offers a separate module where you can easily assign tasks to your team members in a handy overview. Find out all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696175894929-How-To-Planning-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

## Invoices

Ideally, after finishing a project you will want to [invoice](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus) it to your customer. Here you have two options:

- invoice the initial budget you filled in when creating the project

- invoice the time you spent on the project (this is the tracked time when you finished those tasks and meetings) together with the materials

 

Once it’s done, a draft invoice will be created so that you can still review all the details. After that, just book it and send it to the customer!

 

*Pro-tip: The financial forecast*
Users of our [BOOST ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693667750929-Our-BOOST-package)or [FLOW package](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW) can also take a look at the financial forecast to manage their invoices. The financial forecast allows you to see for the current month and the upcoming 2 months how much money will be coming in. Read everything about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693585752209-How-To-The-Financial-Forecast-in-Teamleader-Focus).
