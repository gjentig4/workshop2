# Teamleader Focus for Administrative Users

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692861448593)

 

Are you the person who keeps things running in your company? Do you make your colleagues happy by managing their holidays and their calendars? Do you make sure invoices get paid? Then you are in the right spot! Keep reading for an overview of how Teamleader Focus can help you in your daily job.

 

## Calling

 

If you are manning the phone, you will be happy to hear we have a number of [VoIP integrations](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/eu/en/category/voip) to make calls via click-to-dial and receive calls directly in Teamleader Focus. Take notes in the same screen and log the call directly on the contact or company page so everybody knows what was discussed. 

 

To make your life even easier, you can define default [call outcomes](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691879792273-How-To-Adding-call-outcomes) with follow-up actions. For example: a possible call outcome is ‘voicemail’, which has the follow-up action ‘call’. When you select this outcome, Teamleader Focus will automatically open a new screen to schedule a callback.

 

## Calendar

 

If you are answering phone calls, chances are it is also your responsibility to schedule the follow-up actions for your colleagues. In Teamleader Focus these actions can be calls, tasks or meetings. Besides using the call outcomes as explained above, you can also add them as follows:  

 

Click the links to find an overview of all the ways to add [calls](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691945976209-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-call-in-Teamleader-Focus), [meetings ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691976258193-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-meeting-in-Teamleader-Focus)or [tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691951764497-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-task-in-Teamleader-Focus). Since you are probably already on the contact or company page, the easiest way is to use the big green plus in the top right corner and choose add call, meeting or task. 

 

### Calls

 

Simply pick your colleague’s name in the ‘assigned to’ list and you have added a call for her or him. 

 

### Tasks

 

The same goes for a task, but here you have two extra options: 

- Assign the task to an entire team and let the team decide who will take this up. If you want to know how to create teams, click [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690706850321-How-To-Creating-a-team-in-Teamleader-Focus).

- Or you can work with [unassigned tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697667516817-How-To-Unassigned-tasks-in-Teamleader-Focus). In this case you don't choose a responsable person for the task, and this can still be determined later.

In addition you can choose to just save the task, which will add it to the list of tasks of this colleague (like a to do list), or pick ‘save and schedule’ to pick a specific moment in your colleague’s agenda to perform the task. Another interesting task feature are the internal messages, where you can add files or communicate with each other using the @ symbol.

 

### Meetings

To schedule a meeting for your colleague, just click on the pencil next to ‘colleagues attending’ and check the right name(s). Teamleader Focus also offers the option to set a [departure address](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692040007313-FAQ-How-can-I-edit-the-departure-address-of-a-meeting) for meetings, so you know exactly how much travel time is needed and how much time to leave in between meetings. If your company is using [work orders](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690927285777-How-To-From-work-order-to-invoice), you can even already prepare them straight from the meeting. 

 

You can use the [segments](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus) on call, meeting or task level to create specific overviews of the open actions. For example, use the rule ‘assigned to’ for an overview of all calls of a specific colleague, or the rule ‘creator’ to see the calls you made yourself. If you need to add a lot of calls or tasks, make a segment on company or contact level and click actions to add them in bulk to all the contacts or companies in the segment.

If the follow-up action concerns a deal your colleague is currently working on, make sure to select this deal from the overview, so the [deal activity](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691531578641-FAQ-What-do-the-colours-under-deal-activity-stand-for) is up-to-date.

## Agenda

 

When scheduling these actions in the [agenda](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692428583185-Getting-started-What-is-the-idea-behind-the-calendar-in-Teamleader-Focus), you can select your colleague’s agenda from the list in the right-hand corner. If you cannot see your colleagues in this list, click [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691555792401-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-see-the-calendar-of-my-colleagues). If you want to see the agenda at the same time when adding tasks, meetings or calls, you can open Teamleader Focus in a new tab in your browser to compare both screens. 

 

Besides a day, week or month view, you can select ‘team’ to compare the agenda of several colleagues. Simply hover over a name to delete it from the list, or click the plus sign to add someone. This view does not change during your entire Teamleader Focus session, so you do not need to choose the same colleagues over and over again. Only when you log out and log in again, the default setting is back.

 

Lastly, make sure to have all colleagues [integrate their personal agenda](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690957593745-How-To-Integrate-calendars-with-Teamleader-Focus), so you have a correct overview of their availability, and the actions you scheduled will also show up in their own agendas. 

 

## Lead capture Booster

Running a business without online meetings is hard to imagine in this day and age. That’s why we have our Lead capture Booster in Teamleader Focus. Schedule, meet and engage with customers online, on top of all the other functionality our tool already brings. [Read all about what it is and how to activate it.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25694859794577-How-To-Activate-and-use-the-Lead-capture-Booster)

 

## User management

 

Is it also your duty to keep track of all holidays? Don’t worry, we have got you covered. Click the links to find out how to [configure](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690696602897-How-To-Configuring-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus), [request ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690726245905-How-To-Requesting-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus)and [approve ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691095003153-How-To-Approving-leave-in-Teamleader-Focus)leave in Teamleader Focus *(f**eatures available in our *[*BOOST*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697618837009-Features-per-package-GO-MOVE-BOOST)*[ ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697618837009-Features-per-package-GO-MOVE-BOOST)and [FLOW ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)package).*

If your colleagues get sick, you can keep track of this by creating a holiday type for sick leave. This type should not be restricted though, since it is difficult to put a number on sick days. If the company is closed and nobody will show up for work, you can register this as [closing days.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691773689873-How-To-Working-with-closing-days-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

To have an overview of everyone’s holidays, you can go to **Settings **> **Holiday management **and click on the three dots next to ‘Closing days’. 

 

Are you also in charge of making sure new colleagues get up and running in Teamleader Focus? Our “[Getting Started: HR](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/24833831849361)” section will give you all necessary information on how to add a colleague and how to give her/him the necessary rights.

 

## Invoicing

 

We should also mention the invoicing module. [These articles](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/24833824859537) will guide you through the module step by step. If you do not feel like reading, you can also watch [these video tutorials](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/24834572141457). 

 

When you start to create invoices, you need to decide if you want to book the invoice right away or if you want to create a draft first. As soon as an invoice is booked, it gets a date and a number and we assume it is final. If you create a draft, you can still check it first and [make changes](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691148276241-How-To-How-can-I-edit-my-invoice) before you book it. You can still edit booked invoices, but there are less options and only the [last invoice can be removed](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691485726993-FAQ-Can-I-delete-an-invoice).

 

If you have to invoice time tracking, [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691017896081-How-To-Invoicing-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) will tell you all about it. Do you also send out recurring invoices? Make sure to check out [subscriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691389220881-How-To-Creating-a-subscription-in-Teamleader-Focus) and let Teamleader Focus [send the invoices automatically](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691807856785-FAQ-Can-invoices-from-subscriptions-be-sent-automatically). Add to that a [bookkeeping integration](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/eu/en/category/bookkeeping) and [automatic reminders](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691492744849-FAQ-How-can-I-send-a-reminder-of-an-invoice-in-Teamleader-Focus), and you will have saved yourself a great deal of time.

 

On this level as well you can use the [segments ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)to create specific overviews. For example, create a segment using the rules ‘paid equals no’ and ‘date is previous month’ to have an overview of all unpaid invoices of last month. If you click export in the right hand corner, you can even export this overview to PDF or Excel. As a [BOOST ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693667750929-Our-BOOST-package)or [FLOW ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)customer, you can also use the financial forecast to gain insights in your incoming money. Read all about it [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693585752209-How-To-The-Financial-Forecast-in-Teamleader-Focus). 

 

One last tip: click on the three dots next to ‘Company information’ on the company page and select invoicing preferences to change the settings for a specific company. Here you can add a specific invoicing email address, change the payments terms and the currency, disable automatic reminders and set a price rate for invoicing. 

 

## Time tracking

*(not available in our [GO package](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package))*

 

Since you are a jack of all trades with many responsibilities, keeping track of your own and your colleagues’ time might also be on the list. In [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) you can find all the possible ways to track time in Teamleader Focus. If you need to track time for your colleagues, you can use [these instructions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691666760337-FAQ-Can-I-track-time-for-another-Teamleader-Focus-user). Be sure to check out the [weekly time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) feature as well.
