# Teamleader Focus for Sales

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692881980689)

In this article, we're going to show you how Teamleader Focus can help you organise your funnel to stay on op of your leads.

 

The modules you will mainly use are:

- Companies and Contacts

- Deals and Quotations

- Insights

- Dashboard and Calendar

- 
Lead capture Booster
 

## Companies and Contacts

This is how Teamleader Focus will help you get to know your leads.

 

### Calling up leads

- 
Teamleader Focus offers a great [plugin to connect Teamleader Focus to LinkedIn](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690788964113-How-To-Using-the-LinkedIn-plug-in-in-Teamleader-Focus), allowing you to directly add contacts to Teamleader Focus from LinkedIn.

- 
If you are out and about networking, we imagine you’ll gather lots of business cards. How cool would it be if you didn’t have to add these contacts manually, one by one to your CRM? Just [scan those business cards](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691542613265-FAQ-How-do-I-scan-a-business-card-in-Teamleader-Focus) to add them to your CRM on the spot!

- 
Read everything there is to know about [using Teamleader Focus as a tool for prospecting or as a call center here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693671405073-How-To-Use-Teamleader-Focus-for-prospecting-or-as-a-call-center).

 

### Collecting information

- 
Depending on your sector or type of business, you might be missing some fields to enter more specific info. Just add [custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus). Useful examples of custom fields might be: 

A dropdown with your sectors or verticals

- Custom fields for extra email addresses or phone numbers

- A date field for birthdays of contacts. This might come in handy for mailings.

 

Check with your team and decide together which information is crucial to your team, and then create those custom fields with the suited type.

. 

- 
If you receive emails from contacts that contain important information, you can [track them to Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692591287697-How-To-Tracking-emails-to-Teamleader-Focus). The content of those mails will be saved on the contact or company page, so that you keep a history of what information has been exchanged.

- On that same contact or company page, you will also see related meetings, tasks and calls. This does not only help you, but also your colleagues, who are up-to-date in case a contact calls when you are not available.

- 
And what if a contact tells you something your colleague urgently needs to know? Go to the activities at the bottom of a contact or company page and add an @-sign. You’ll see a dropdown with the name of all users within your account, so click on the name of your colleague and type your note. Your colleague will receive a notification.

## Deals and Quotations

The deal and quotation modules will be your favourite ones. [A deal](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692361765777-Getting-started-What-is-a-deal) should be created whenever a business opportunity arises. If your company has several services or has different sales teams or company entities, you can [define different sales pipelines](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus) that match your specific methods. [Create quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693612763409-FAQ-How-can-I-create-a-quotation-in-Teamleader-Focus) to sell goods/services to your customer. Creating [multiple quotations per deal](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus) is a handy feature too if you want to offer different options to your customer.

 

### Segments

[Segments ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus)will help your follow-up by dividing your deals by date or amount, for example. In the list view of your deals, Teamleader Focus also has a filter by deal phase. As we explained before, you can also create [custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus) on deal level in order to add specific sales content to each deal.
 

### Pipeline & deal phases

The phases in a deal pipeline show you the steps a lead has to go through before becoming a customer. Click on the little ball on the phase to mark it as fulfilled. You can, of course, [customize the phases and add/edit/remove them](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691597918737-How-To-Managing-deal-phases) via **Settings > Deals and Quotations > **Pipelines > Click on the **pencil **next to the phase. More information about changing the dates can be found [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693825469585-FAQ-Can-I-change-the-date-of-a-deal-phase).

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692852446865)

- 
Sometimes, the deal phases jump automatically. This happens on two occasions: when [sending a quotation](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691228260881-How-To-Email-templates-for-quotations-invoices-and-meetings) and if (one of) the [quotation(s) is accepted via CloudSign](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign).

- 
[Via the scheduled actions on your deal page,](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) you can link meetings, tasks and calls to the deal, so you won’t lose your potential customer out of sight. [You can even link follow-up actions to your deal phases](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697662084497-How-To-Follow-up-actions-on-deals-deal-automation)*.*
In case you weren’t able to reach the contact today, just create a task or a call for yourself within a few days to check again.

### Activity meter

 

In the deal overview, you find specific colours under the column[ Activity](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691531578641-FAQ-What-do-the-colours-under-deal-activity-stand-for), which let you know what deals need attention. Determine the time span via **Settings > Deals and Quotations > **Pipelines > **Pencil **next to a deal phase.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692869609873)

### Probability rate

You can also set a [probability %](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692348917137-Getting-started-How-do-you-want-to-manage-your-deals) for each phase of your deal funnel. This allows you to get a weighted amount per deal in the statistics, so that you get a realistic forecast. To do so, you can add the columns ‘Amount’, ‘Probability’, ‘Expected close date’ and ‘Weighted amount’ to the Deals overview. We however recommend you to use our [deal forecast, which you can read about here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697739813521-How-To-The-deal-forecast-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

## Insights

Under Insights, you’ll find extensive reports on deals such as deal cycle length or your yearly sales performance. Customise your reports further by filtering the results by deal pipeline or assignee, or adapt the time frame. [Read more about it here. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/28242396199953-How-To-Insights-library-on-CRM-Sales-and-Productivity-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

## Dashboard and Calendar

The Dashboard (clicking on the Teamleader Focus logo in the top-left corner) shows you today’s agenda. This should be the first thing you look at in the mornings, while you drink your coffee.

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692843270801)

Here you will find all the tasks, meetings and calls that you have to do today, or that were due in the previous 7 days. 

 

As a best practice, we recommend that every time a task, meeting or a call is done, [you mark it as done](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692438339729-Getting-started-What-is-the-idea-behind-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) in Teamleader Focus, or at least that you do it before you go home that day. If you haven’t finished your work and can’t mark them as done, you can move them to a later date. This allows you to go home with a clear mind. Keeping this discipline is the way to #worksmarter!

 

*Pro-tip: Recording your meeting report*

Here’s another trick applied by our customers for keeping notes of a meeting. When you finish a meeting, you have the option to create a [meeting report](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692057110801-FAQ-Can-I-create-a-meeting-report). But if you don’t want to spend time writing, you can also finish the meeting using the [Teamleader Focus app](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691083613201-FAQ-What-can-the-Teamleader-Focus-app-do). You can create a report by recording your voice, using the mic on your mobile phone. Each customer has a ‘**Files**’ tab where you can upload these documents so that you, or any of your colleagues can find them quickly.
