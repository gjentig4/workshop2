# What are e-invoicing and Peppol all about?

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)
E-invoicing is set to become mandatory in all European countries by 2030. For Belgium, e-invoicing already became mandatory on 01/01/2026. This article covers the essentials e-invoicing is, what the implementation is for each country and what Peppol means.

# E-invoicing & country-specific implementation 

The European Union decided that **by 2030 all member states should enforce digital invoicing in a B2B (Business to business) context** to combat fraud. Each member state has some freedom to decide how and when this comes into effect. 
 

## Belgium

In Belgium, e-invoicing was only required in a B2G (Business to government) context for some time. The Belgian government uses the software Mercurius to receive, process, and send e-invoices and other documents in UBL format.
 

**For B2B though, digital invoicing became mandatory too since 01/01/2026. **Belgium opted for the Peppol network to comply with EU regulations. 
 

In practice, this means that all B2B invoices have to be sent digitally in Belgium since January 2026.

- A Belgian company sending an invoice to another Belgian company must do so via the Peppol network.

- Invoices created via Word or Excel and sent in PDF format are no longer accepted in Belgium from January 2026. 
 

**As a Belgian customer, you must therefore have a software tool that can send and receive invoices to be compliant with the legislation around e-invoicing. Teamleader Focus has got you covered!**
 

## Netherlands

The Dutch government has not communicated a deadline for implementing e-invoicing for B2B, so for now, nothing changes for our Dutch customers. 
 

! Sending invoices to the Dutch government (they are using the software Digipoort), is already mandatory via Peppol.
 

## France

The e-invoicing deadline for France is 01/09/2026. 
 

Currently we don’t have more information on when e-invoicing via Teamleader Focus will be available for France.
 

## Germany

The e-invoicing deadline for Germany is 01/01/2027. 
 

Currently we don’t have more information on when e-invoicing via Teamleader Focus will be available for Germany.
 

## Italy

In some countries like Italy, the government has already imposed e-invoicing to exchange invoices both in a B2G and a B2B context.

For specific information about e-invoicing in Italy, [please consult the following article.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693046603665-How-To-Activating-Italian-e-invoicing-functionality-in-Teamleader-Focus)
 

# What is Peppol?

**Peppol **(Pan-European Public Procurement Online) is an international network that allows companies and government agencies to **securely send and receive electronic documents. **The main goal of Peppol is to make electronic connections with partners (f.e. E-invoicing) faster & simpler by providing universal formats for a wide range of documents.

 

Peppol provides both the **formal requirements** that different documents (such as invoices) should meet, as well as the **network **over which they should be exchanged. An **e-invoice** is an invoice created in the **UBL **standard and sent or received via the Peppol network. The formal requirements are described in each UBL* version, the network consists of access points that are officially certified by the Peppol organisation. 

**UBL: Universal Business Language. UBL is a standard format used for electronic invoicing and it allows computers to read so-called XML files. *

 

## Peppol ID

Quickly summarised, this is how it works:

- You need software to send and receive e-invoices via Peppol and this is where Teamleader Focus comes in.

- Your customer needs to be registered on Peppol too, no matter which tool (could be Teamleader Focus or not).

- The software gives you something to identify yourself with: a **Peppol ID**. For Belgium, this is a unique code and consists of the prefix 0208 combined with your KBO number, or 9925 combined with your VAT number.

- You can send the UBL together with the PDF from Teamleader Focus to your customer's software, and it's readable. You send based on your Peppol ID to the other participant's Peppol ID.

 

## Peppol registration vs Peppol connection

Important to note is that there’s a difference between Peppol registration and being connected to Peppol. 

- You can **send invoices using different software** tools by **connecting **to Peppol. [Read more about sending invoices through Peppol here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/30085139646225-How-To-Sending-e-invoices-via-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)

- However, you can only **register with one software tool.** When you register, you indicate that you want to receive your invoices in that tool. [Read more about receiving invoices through Peppol here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/28079545197713-How-To-Receiving-e-invoices-via-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

Compare it with sending a letter. You can drop a letter in the mailbox in every city, and it will reach the customer. You can even be homeless; your letter will still arrive. But if you want to receive a package (invoice), you need an address to receive it (Peppol ID); that’s what you get when you register on Peppol.
