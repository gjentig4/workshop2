# FAQ: What if I'm already registered to Peppol elsewhere?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)
If you’re already registered to Peppol somewhere else, this means you will receive invoices, credit notes and messages there. If you want to keep it that way, that's fine, and we will give you the option to only send invoices via Teamleader Focus and not receive them. If you prefer to use our tool for both sending *and *receiving, that's even better! In that case you'll need to deregister your other registration before we can register you on our own Peppol access point. Read everything about it here.

 

# Enable Peppol

To enable Peppol in your account, you need [admin rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) and access to the Settings. [Find more information about enabling Peppol here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-E-invoicing-and-how-do-I-send-invoices-via-the-Peppol-network)

Go to **Settings > Company information > Company entities**.

When clicking **Enable Peppol** next to your entity, we’ll be able to detect if your KBO number or VAT number is already registered on Peppol elsewhere. If that’s the case, we’ll inform you of this.

# Send and receive documents and status updates

If you're already registered somewhere else but prefer to use our tool for both sending and receiving documents, use [peppolscanner.be](https://peppolscanner.be/) to look up where you're already registered.

- 
Remove your Peppol integration (this should also deregister you from their Access Point and shouldn’t take too long).
If you’re having trouble removing the integration, please contact the support team of your current Peppol provider.
Below you find a list of possible providers and their support email address.

- 
In your Peppol settings you’ll see ‘Enabled’ next to ‘Sending’, but ‘Disabled’ next to ‘Receiving. After deregistering you will be able to activate Peppol for receiving documents again by clicking on **Activate receiving documents.**

If something still went wrong during the registration process, please contact [peppol@teamleader.eu](mailto:peppol@teamleader.eu) for further assistance.
 

# Only send documents

You can send e-invoices through Peppol via various software tools, but you can only receive e-invoices in one tool. If you're already registered somewhere else for receiving, we will detect this and only activate Peppol for sending documents. You can always activate receiving documents at a later point in time though by clicking on **Activate receiving documents **next to 'Receiving'.

 

- If you already registered for receiving Peppol documents in Teamleader Focus but want to deactivate receiving, then you first need to deactivate Peppol fully in Teamleader Focus, register for receiving in the other tool and then enable Peppol for sending only again in Teamleader Focus.

- If you're not registered anywhere else but still only want to use Teamleader Focus for sending e-invoices, you have to first register to receive via Peppol in another tool. Afterwards, you can still decide to also receive via Teamleader Focus.
