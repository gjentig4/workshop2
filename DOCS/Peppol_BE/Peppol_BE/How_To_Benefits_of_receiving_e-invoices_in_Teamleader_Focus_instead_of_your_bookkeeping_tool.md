# How To: Benefits of receiving e-invoices in Teamleader Focus instead of your bookkeeping tool

![A 'How To' tutorial banner featuring a wrench and gear illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690662955153)*This article explains the benefits of receiving e-invoices in Teamleader Focus, currently available to our Belgian or Luxembourg customers.*
 

The shift to mandatory e-invoicing in the EU is changing how businesses manage their invoices. Instead of using separate bookkeeping software for incoming invoices, managing everything directly in Teamleader Focus is a smarter and more efficient choice. 
 

Know that you can send e-invoices from multiple tools, but you [can only receive e-invoices in one tool.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/28079545197713-How-To-Receiving-e-invoices-via-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus) Which tool to pick if you already have a bookkeeping tool in which you receive your invoices? This is an important choice to make and this choice is of course yours, but we advise you to use Teamleader Focus to receive e-invoices as well. Why? We listed all the benefits below:
 

# 1. A complete view of incoming and outgoing invoices in one place

In Teamleader Focus, all your invoices—both incoming and outgoing—are housed under one roof. This offers several advantages:

- **Centralised access:** If you receive your e-invoices in Teamleader Focus, you can access them under **Expenses.**

- **Preview and details:** View the PDF layout of received invoices, or examine the UBL data directly for a complete breakdown of invoice information.

- **Notification system: **Stay informed with notifications through the platform and email whenever a new incoming invoice or credit note is received.

- 
[**Centralised Peppol management**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-e-invoicing-and-how-do-I-enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)**:** You can send (e-)invoices using multiple tools, but for receiving invoices, Peppol must be enabled in one tool—and Teamleader Focus is perfectly equipped for this.

- 
Keeping e-invoices within Teamleader Focus ensures** smoother collaboration between departments**.
 

# 2. Check before sending to your accountant

If you receive e-invoices, surely you also prefer to check them before sending them to the accountant or your bookkeeping software? Once you verify them, you of course still need to pay them.

- 
You can easily export your received invoices as PDFs or UBLs for external use, such as sharing with your bookkeeper.
 

That’s why it is better to choose software that can send and receive e-invoices. That way, you have control over what is coming in and going out, without having to consult an accountant.
 

# 3. Responses on outgoing invoices

Receiving e-invoices in Teamleader Focus also means that you are able to receive responses of your customers via Peppol on your outgoing invoices. This is a great advantage over receiving them in another bookkeeping tool in which you aren’t able to receive those.

# 4. Future-proof features for invoice management

Teamleader Focus is continuously improving its e-invoicing capabilities, ensuring your business is ready for the future:

- **Bookkeeping integration:** While automatic syncing of incoming invoices with your bookkeeping software is not yet available, Teamleader Focus plans to expand this functionality.

- 
**Invoice payment solutions**: Although paying invoices directly in the platform isn’t possible yet,[ integrations like Ponto already allow you to mark invoices as paid in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697624265361-How-To-Setting-invoices-to-paid-with-Ponto)

- 
**Projects & orders**: Features such as linking incoming invoices to projects or orders are on the roadmap, offering even more value in the near future.
