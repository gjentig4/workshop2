![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/28080424040849)

 

Sending and receiving invoices via Peppol will become mandatory in several European countries for B2B in the upcoming years. This means you will be receiving e-invoices from your suppliers via Peppol. We got you covered, as our Belgian and Luxembourg customers are able to receive their e-invoices directly in their Teamleader Focus account. Read all about it here.

# Enable Peppol

Even if you don’t send e-invoices yourself or only send B2C invoices, you will need to enable Peppol to receive invoices via the Peppol network if your business falls within the mandatory B2B e-invoicing regulations in Belgium.
 

! The invoices you send to your private customers (B2C) do not have to go through Peppol. Those may still be sent by mail or post. 
 

In order to receive invoices through Peppol in Teamleader Focus, you need to make sure Peppol is enabled in your account. [Follow the instructions in this article to enable Peppol. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-E-invoicing-and-how-do-I-send-invoices-via-the-Peppol-network)
 

You can **send invoices from multiple instances/tools if you want**. This means that next to from Teamleader Focus, you could technically also use additional tools to send your invoices from. [Find more information about sending invoices here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/30085139646225-How-To-Sending-e-invoices-via-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus) As for **receiving **invoices, you **can only enable Peppol in one software tool**. 
 

# Receive invoices via Peppol

Go to **Expenses. **Here you can find all your expenses. You can recognise the received documents sent by your suppliers via the document type 'Incoming invoice' or by adding the column 'Origin' (Peppol) to your column overview:

*Note*: If you receive an invoice via Peppol and the supplier is not yet in your CRM, we will automatically create it for you and link to it. This way all invoices will be linked to a supplier so you can have a better overview.

**Click **on an invoice and you’ll see a **preview **of the PDF:

In most cases, UBLs of e-invoices will have a PDF embedded, so we can preview the layout of the invoice. In case the provider of your supplier didn’t attach a PDF, we will show the UBL's data in a readable way in Teamleader Focus. Go to the tab **Details **to check that information. If there are additional invoice attachments, you'll also find these in the **Details** > 'Attachments' tab:

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/40990177664273)

- There's a limit of 200 attachments for incoming invoices and the combined size cannot exceed 100 MB

- The supported formats are .jpg, .png, .pdf, .csv and .xlsx
 

If you agree with the invoice, [you can approve it ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357191325201-How-To-Approve-or-refuse-expenses-in-Teamleader-Focus)and [send it to your bookkeeper](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357221963409-How-To-Send-expenses-to-your-bookkeeping-in-Teamleader-Focus) via the buttons in the top right-hand corner of the expense:

# Q&A receiving invoices

**Can I send incoming invoices to my bookkeeping software?**

At this time, there is no option to automatically sync incoming invoices to your bookkeeping integration [as is possible with outgoing invoices](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691318213393-FAQ-What-are-the-available-bookkeeping-integrations-in-Teamleader-Focus-per-country). You can send them manually though [via the button **Send to bookkeeper.**](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/34357221963409-How-To-Send-expenses-to-your-bookkeeping-in-Teamleader-Focus)
 

**Can I pay incoming invoices via Teamleader Focus?**

At this point in time, no. We will be working on a solution for this though. In the meantime [you can work with Ponto to set your invoices to paid in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697624265361-How-To-Setting-invoices-to-paid-with-Ponto)
 

**Can I link incoming invoices to orders? **

Not yet, but this is something we will expand upon when we continue working on costs in general.
