# FAQ: What if my Peppol invoice was sent but not received?

![A graphic banner featuring the text 'FAQ' with a magnifying glass and a document icon.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25690748323089)##  

When you send an invoice via Peppol but the recipient claims they haven’t received it, there are several things you can check to identify the cause and resolve the issue.
 

# Check the Peppol status of the invoice

On the invoice page, look for the Peppol status. Possible statuses include:

- Sending

- Sent

- Sending failed

- Accepted

- Refused
 

Also check if there is an error message or reason displayed under "Peppol status."

You can review the activity history of the invoice to see the full sequence of events.

 

# If the status is 'Sent' but the recipient hasn’t received it

- Verify that the correct Peppol ID or VAT number was used for the recipient

- If this seems fine, ask the recipient to check their own system for any error messages

- 
Ensure that the recipient’s Peppol registration is correct and active

 

# If the status is 'Sending failed'

- Create a credit note for the original invoice

- Create a new invoice

- Send the new invoice again via Peppol
 

# Technical information and troubleshooting

For security reasons, detailed technical logs cannot be shared with external parties. If the recipient needs technical details for troubleshooting, they should:

- Contact their own Peppol access point provider

- Check their own system for any error messages

- Confirm that their Peppol registration and settings are correct
