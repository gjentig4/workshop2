# General

**What does e-invoicing mean?**
With e-invoicing, you invoice by means of an invoice in UBL format. This invoice is sent via the Peppol network. 
 

**Is e-invoicing mandatory?**
E-invoicing is mandatory in Belgium for both B2G and B2B transactions. The rest of the EU will soon follow, as e-invoicing should be the norm in the EU by 2030.
 

**How do I create a UBL invoice?**
Specific invoicing software does that for you. That software converts what you have on your invoice to the right format that can be read by Peppol and other invoicing software that can receive e-invoices, among others.
 

**As a Belgian company, do I need to send invoices to other countries via Peppol?**

No, only to other BE companies. You can still use regular email to send your invoices to other countries. It's however possible to send invoices via Peppol to Dutch and Luxembourg companies from your Belgian company entity.
 

**As a non-Belgian company, do I need to send invoices via Peppol to my BE customers? **

No for B2B: You can send invoices to your Belgian customer via email. 
 

Yes for B2G: If you send invoices to the Belgian/Dutch government, you need to use Peppol. 

- If you need to send an invoice to the Belgian government, you can manually create your invoice in Mercurius platform.

- If you need to send an invoice to the Dutch government, you can manually upload your invoices for the Dutch government via the portal of the ‘Rijksoverheid’.
 

**As a Belgian company, I only invoice to customers (B2C), not businesses. Does the Belgian e-invoicing ruling apply to me?**

Yes, because the ruling also applies not only to sending but also to receiving invoices. You will also have to receive e-invoices via Peppol from your Belgian suppliers. So even if you only send invoices to non-business customers, you’ll also need a way to receive your B2B invoices via Peppol. 

However, your invoices to non-B2B customers can’t go via Peppol. These still need to be regular PDFs or on paper.
 

**For which Teamleader Focus packages is sending and receiving e-invoices available?**

Sending invoices via Peppol is available for all packages.

Receiving invoices via Peppol is also available for all packages but the only exception are users of the [SMART package.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)
 

**Is there an extra cost related to e-invoicing?**

No. It’s a regulation that our customers need to comply with. We just want all of our (potential) customers to have the best experience in complying with the law. That’s why we try to make it as easy as possible for them. Let us do the heavy lifting.
 

**Is Teamleader Focus also compliant for Peppol in other countries e.g. Italy? **

No, Italy does not use Peppol for its e-invoices. And even if other countries do use Peppol, there are subtle differences per country. We’ll be developing e-invoicing for Germany first, because Germany will introduce Peppol in 2025 already. After that, we’ll keep you posted on which countries are next.
 

# Registering on Peppol

**What does Peppol registration mean and is it the same as connecting to Peppol?**

No - You can send invoices using different software tools by connecting to Peppol.
However, you can only register with one software tool. When you register, you indicate that you want to receive your invoices in that tool.
 

**How can my suppliers know I’m registered on Peppol and how can they find me? **

They can find you based on your KBO number (BCE in Wallonia). Your KBO number in Belgium is your VAT number without the “BE” (so only the numbers). Via the website [peppolscanner.be](https://peppolscanner.be/) they can also check if and where you're registered on Peppol.
 

**How do I know if my customer is registered on Peppol?**

Teamleader Focus knows. We will look for your customer in the Peppol database. If your customer is registered on Peppol, Teamleader Focus will give you the option to send your e-invoice via the Peppol network.

If they’re not (yet) registered on Peppol, you can still send your invoice via the regular channels (post, email…)

Know that you can also check for yourself if a company is already registered on Peppol via the website [peppolscanner.be](https://peppolscanner.be/). 

 

**What if I want to send an invoice via Peppol but my customer isn't registered on Peppol yet?**
If your customer is not (yet) registered on Peppol, you won’t be able to select Peppol as a sending option in Teamleader Focus. In that case, you are allowed to send the invoice via another channel, such as email.

Customers who are not compliant after 01/01/2026 risk financial penalties:

- €1,500 for a first offence

- €3,000 for a second offence

- €5,000 for each subsequent offence
 

There is a three-month grace period between offences. After that, any new offence will result in a higher fine.
 

Best practice in this situation:

- Check with your customer whether it’s correct that they are not registered on Peppol yet (they may have a different Peppol ID).

- Inform them that Peppol registration is mandatory.

- Ask when they expect to be registered, so you can send future invoices via Peppol.

- Clearly state in your email that the invoice is sent via email because the customer is not registered on Peppol yet, so you have proof as a supplier.

 

**Can I register multiple entities with the same VAT number?**

You can register one company entity with a unique KBO or VAT number to both send and receive invoices via Peppol. However, if other entities share the same KBO or VAT number, they can only be registered for sending invoices. 
If such a sending-only entity receives a response to an invoice it sent through Peppol, the response will still be correctly linked to the original invoice—even though that entity isn’t registered for receiving.

 

# Sending e-invoices

**Can I send Peppol invoices via Teamleader Focus but receive Peppol invoices somewhere else?**

Yes, that’s possible. You can send from multiple instances if you want, but you can only receive at one place (similar to your home address). However, it’s always better to have everything in one place, is it not?
 

**I made a mistake after sending my invoice via Peppol (forgot PO number, wrong address, etc.. ). Can I edit it and send it again via Peppol?**

Peppol does not allow the same invoice to be sent twice with the same number as the invoice is already processed by the other company’s software. You need to make a credit note, copy the original invoice, update it to fix the mistakes and send the new one via Peppol. 
 

**What if I need to send an invoice reminder?**

You can’t send an invoice reminder through Peppol. If your customer did not pay, you can send an email reminder repeating the original invoice was sent via Peppol, and you can include the original invoice as a PDF.
 

**Can I also send Peppol invoices to the government via Teamleader Focus (B2G)?**

Yes! Invoices to the Belgian and Dutch government (B2G) should also be sent through Peppol. This is also possible in Teamleader Focus as we can identify these government instances too. 
 

**What for invoices that are sent automatically via subscriptions?**

Invoices that are sent automatically via subscriptions will also automatically be sent via Peppol if this option is enabled. [Read all about that here.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691807856785-FAQ-Can-invoices-from-subscriptions-be-sent-automatically)

**What if I receive an error message after sending?**

You may get a message after sending a Peppol invoice that your invoice has been rejected for the following reason: ‘IO (97) must contain at least 8 numbers’. [This is because you have not entered a purchase order number or PO number. ](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692069252497-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-PO-number-to-an-invoice)

- Firstly, you need to enable this setting (Go to **Settings **> **Revenue **> **Preferences **> 'Use PO numbers on your invoices'). From now on, you will be able to enter a PO number when creating an invoice.

- Secondly, you cannot edit an invoice and resend it via Peppol. Therefore you need to make a credit note of the already sent invoice, copy the original invoice, update it to enter the PO number and send the new one via Peppol.
 

**I can't send my invoice because the delivery date is required?**

Invoices with the VAT rate “Sales inside EU” or "Sales inside EU services" require a delivery date. This is a Peppol requirement.
You can fill in the delivery date of your invoice when creating or editing it, in the field 'Delivery date'.
 

# Receiving e-invoices

(*not available in our SMART package)*

 

**Can I send Peppol invoices via Teamleader Focus but receive Peppol invoices somewhere else?**

Yes, that’s possible. You can send from multiple instances if you want, but you can only receive at one place (similar to your home address). However, it’s always better to have everything in one place, is it not?
 

**Can I link incoming invoices to e.g. projects or orders?**

Not yet, but this is something we will expand upon when we continue working on costs & incoming invoices in general.
 

**Can I pay incoming invoices via Teamleader Focus?**
At this point in time, no. We will be working on a solution for this though. In the meantime [you can work with Ponto to set your invoices to paid in Teamleader Focus.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697624265361-How-To-Setting-invoices-to-paid-with-Ponto)
 

# Bookkeeping

**Can I still send my outgoing invoices to my bookkeeping tool via Teamleader Focus?**

You can still sync outgoing invoices to your [bookkeeping software](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691318213393-FAQ-What-are-the-available-bookkeeping-integrations-in-Teamleader-Focus-per-country) via Teamleader Focus (if you have an integration), even if they are sent via Peppol.
 

**Can I send incoming invoices to my bookkeeping software?**

At this time, there is no option to automatically sync incoming invoices to your bookkeeping integration [as is possible with outgoing invoices](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691318213393-FAQ-What-are-the-available-bookkeeping-integrations-in-Teamleader-Focus-per-country). We will work on this in the future though. For now, you can download your invoice via UBL/PDF and manually upload it in your bookkeeping software.
 

# Archive/delete company entity or downgrade/churn

**What happens if I archive/delete my company entity?**

If you archive or delete one or more company entities, you will be deregistered from Peppol for the VAT and KBO numbers linked to that entity.
 

**What happens if I downgrade to the SMART package and can't receive e-invoices anymore? **

You will no longer be able to receive e-invoices via Peppol. This means you'll loose access to the module 'Expenses' and thus also to the e-invoices you received.
 

**What happens if I stop using Teamleader Focus?**

If you decide to stop using Teamleader Focus, we will deregister you from Peppol. You will no longer receive invoices via Peppol, so you’ll need to reregister in another software.
