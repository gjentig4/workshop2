# How To: Choose a different Peppol identifier for your customer

![SupportCentre_Howto.png](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/38324220180497) 

Sometimes you might need to use a different Peppol ID for a customer, and that's totally possible in Teamleader Focus! By default, Teamleader Focus sends Peppol documents to your customer’s primary identifier. In Belgium for example, this primary identifier is typically assigned to the customer based on their KBO number. However, there might be situations where you need to use a different identifier to ensure the document reaches the correct recipient. Read this article to learn more.

 

*Important to note is that you can only set a different Peppol identifier if you have a Belgian or Luxembourg company entity and you activated Peppol in your account already. *[*Read more about that here.*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-e-invoicing-and-how-do-I-enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

# Why change the Peppol identifier?

By default, Teamleader Focus sends Peppol documents to your customer’s primary identifier (for Belgium this is based on the KBO number). There are several reasons why you may need to select a different Peppol identifier for a customer:

- Your customer has multiple registered Peppol identifiers.

- The default identifier is outdated or incorrect.

- The recipient has specific preferences for receiving documents under a different identifier.

- The document needs to be directed to a specific department or branch within a larger organisation.

 

# Set a different Peppol identifier

Teamleader Focus allows you to manually select a different identifier. Here’s how you can do it:

- Navigate to the **company **you want to set a different Peppol identifier for

- Click on the **three dots **next to ‘Company information’

- Choose **Invoicing preferences**

- 
In ‘Send invoices via Peppol to’, you’ll see that ‘Automatic’ is selected by default. Change this to ‘**Other**’:

A Peppol identifier consists of a prefix based on a KBO number, a VAT number* or another identifier like GLN or DUNS, followed by the actual identification number. This ensures that documents are routed correctly within the network. If you're not sure which Peppol identifier to use, keep this setting to "Automatic". Only use this when your customer specifically asks for it.

**Note for Luxembourg: Teamleader Focus also supports the RPM or TIN number for Luxembourg. In Luxembourg it's common practice to fill it out in the VAT field though, so choose that as prefix for your Peppol identifier.*
 

- Click on **Next step.**

- From now on, your Peppol invoices will be sent to this Peppol identifier.
