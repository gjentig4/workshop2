# Getting started: How can you collaborate smarter in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692482622225)

 

- *How do you collaborate within your company?*

- *Do you have teams which work together on a daily basis?*

- *Which of your co-workers needs to have access to what in Teamleader Focus?*

 

In order to structure the collaboration within a company, Teamleader Focus offers the[ option to create teams](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690706850321-How-To-Creating-a-team-in-Teamleader-Focus). You can add a colleague to a team to facilitate the collaboration if you have a bigger crew to coordinate. Obviously, it is entirely up to you how many colleagues are using Teamleader Focus. Just check here how[ to add](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690695274513-How-To-Adding-new-users-to-your-Teamleader-Focus-account),[ to deactivate](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690718823953-How-To-Deactivating-a-user-in-Teamleader-Focus) or[ reactivate](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691440749201-FAQ-How-can-I-reactivate-my-co-worker) a colleague.

 

When adding a colleague, you need to decide whether every colleague should have access to everything. You have different choices: you can [make another colleague an administrator](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690956768913-FAQ-How-can-I-grant-or-remove-administrator-rights) so that this user has the[ same rights](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) as you, but you can also opt for limiting the visibility by[ limited CRM](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692271859857-FAQ-What-does-limited-CRM-access-stand-for), [limited deal access](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691455806993-FAQ-What-does-limited-deal-access-mean) or by[ deactivating certain modules for some users](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691605666193-FAQ-Why-do-I-not-have-the-same-features-in-my-Teamleader-Focus-account-as-my-colleague). In the end you are the boss.

 

Note: As soon as a colleague is set up, he/she should edit and update their[ personal profile](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691914966673-How-To-Setting-up-my-personal-Teamleader-Focus-account) in order to get started.
