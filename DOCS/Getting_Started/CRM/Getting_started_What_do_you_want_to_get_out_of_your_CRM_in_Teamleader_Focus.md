# Getting started: What do you want to get out of your CRM in Teamleader Focus?

- *What is the main goal of having everything documented in Teamleader Focus?*

- *How do you want to fill your CRM?*

Would you like to use CRM software to store all necessary information of your contacts? Send mailings? See what's going on within your business in the blink of an eye?

 

With Teamleader Focus, all of that is possible, and more. But we do advise you to consider how you plan on using the tool, so you can fill and structure your database accordingly.

 

Before **adding data** to Teamleader Focus, you should know what information you want to track and check the standard fields for contacts and companies we offer. Should you identify gaps, do know that Teamleader Focus offers two different ways to add additional information on contacts or companies.

 

Teamleader Focus offers **tags** that serve as post-its: what role does this contact or company have? These tags should be short pieces of information, as long texts will result in death and destruction on earth. No, seriously - adding long texts will make you lose overview and cause chaos. So what are good examples of tags? "potential customer", "customer", "supplier", ...

Another possibility is **custom fields**. Teamleader Focus offers standard fields for contacts and companies, but perhaps you'd like to add some extra information. That's where our custom fields come in. Basically, these fields allow you to add any extra information - after all, you never know when the birthday of a contact's mother may come in handy. But it's important to know which type of custom field you need, and on which level it needs to be created. Be sure to read the [following article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692101619217-FAQ-What-do-the-settings-of-a-custom-field-stand-for) to get a general overview and a deeper understanding of the settings of custom fields.

 

Tags and custom fields are very important when it comes to structuring your CRM tool, as you can create lists based on them. Those lists can then be exported, but also used for **mailings**. We'll provide you with more information on that later on, but it's worth keeping in mind for now.

 

Before you start importing your data, be clear about whether you'd like to label them right away, whether [companies have related contacts](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691225593361-FAQ-Can-I-also-import-the-related-company-when-importing-contacts-into-Teamleader-Focus) or vice versa, and what custom fields are needed. We advise you to create the needed custom fields first, so you have the option to choose the right type. As soon as you decided which information is needed, you can start [importing your existing list of customers, suppliers, etc.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691800529297-How-To-Importing-contacts-and-companies-to-Teamleader-Focus)

 

Make sure you export a list from your previous software and/or current software. This could save you lots of time in creating the Excel sheet you need, which all serves your ultimate goal: to work smarter.

 

You also have the option to add a contact or company **manually**.
