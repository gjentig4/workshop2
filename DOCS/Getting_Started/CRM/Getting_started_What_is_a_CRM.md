At Teamleader Focus, we aim to make your life as easy as possible. But *noblesse oblige*: sometimes, we feel the need to use big words and abbreviations. Take CRM (Customer Relationship Management) for example: just three letters, that mean the world to any business.

 

Basically, **a CRM tool is a database of all your contacts and companies you interact with**. But it's more than just an Excel sheet. It allows you to add all the information you need, see open meetings, tasks, and so on at a glance, and follow up which emails have been sent or which meetings have taken place.

 

In addition, you can grant colleagues access, to avoid data redundancy or double work. Sounds great, doesn't it? Sure it does. So, what are we waiting for? Let's get you started!
