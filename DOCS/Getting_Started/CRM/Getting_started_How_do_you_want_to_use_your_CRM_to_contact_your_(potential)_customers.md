# Getting started: How do you want to use your CRM to contact your (potential) customers?

- *How do (potential) customers seek contact?*

- *How should they be added?*

- *How do you get in touch with them?*

 

If many potential customers reach out to you by visiting your **website**, it may be worth your while to add a contact form. With Teamleader Focus, you can link these forms to your account, meaning any data entered in these forms will automatically be added to your database. We offer integrations with four Web2Leads services ([Jotform](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691809384721-How-To-Connect-Jotform-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead),[ Unbounce](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691771689361-How-To-Connect-Unbounce-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead),[ Formstack](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691775121297-How-To-Connect-Formstack-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead) and[ Wufoo](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691807372433-How-To-Connect-Wufoo-with-Teamleader-Focus-Web2Lead)).

 

You can also use the [API](https://developer.teamleader.eu/) if you know how to do so. Thanks to these integrations, leads that fill out a contact form on your website will immediately be added to your CRM, and you can even choose to create a new deal automatically. This helps you avoid any leads falling through the cracks. Another option to add your (potential) customers to Teamleader Focus, is by using our email integration with Gmail or Outlook. If you use the Outlook integration, not only will you be able to [track your emails directly to Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692591287697-How-To-Tracking-emails-to-Teamleader-Focus), but you can also add unknown contacts to your account at the click of a mouse. Again, you only add those contacts that you want to add to your database.

 

In case you want to send **newsletters** to your customers, Teamleader Focus also offers an integration with [MailChimp](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690774879889-How-To-Sending-email-campaigns-with-Mailchimp-in-Teamleader-Focus) and[ Campaign Monitor](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690737500305-How-To-Sending-email-campaign-with-Campaign-Monitor-in-Teamleader-Focus). If you link your Teamleader Focus account to one of these tools, you can base your emailing lists on existing Teamleader Focus segments. Important to mention here, however: before setting up your CRM database, you should determine what value you'd like to use as the basis for your segments and mailing lists. Do you filter on tags or rather on another piece of information? Make sure this value is displayed in Teamleader Focus the right way. What are segments? Read all about it on [this page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus).
