# Getting started: How can you manage a project?

*![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692413794065)*
 

Manage and maintain an overview of your project at all times with the following functionalities within a project.

 

## Work breakdown

The work breakdown tab allows you to make clear estimates of the required work per project group and allows you to keep your projects perfectly under control. Add tasks, meetings and materials to your project here. Find more information [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695560896145-How-To-Add-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

## Project info

You can find this information under the 'Project info' tab in your project.

 

### Budget Spent

'Budget spent' on a project displays your customer's budget and how much billable hours are spent. Budget management on projects is a way to keep track of the predetermined budget you and your customer have agreed upon. By allocating resources and estimating time on billable tasks & meetings, you'll know if you are going over budget.

 

### Margin

Each project visualises its profit by giving an overview of the costs you've incurred in relation to the revenue of the project.

 

### Time tracking overview

Next to your margin, you'll see the section "Time tracked", where you'll find an overview of your billable and non-billable hours.

 

You can export an overview of all time tracking linked to the project into different formats (Excel and PDF). Go to your project and click on the **three dots **in the top right-hand corner > **Export ****timesheet**.

 

## Invoices

Find an overview of the invoice(s) linked to your project or add new ones. Read all about invoicing a project [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus).
