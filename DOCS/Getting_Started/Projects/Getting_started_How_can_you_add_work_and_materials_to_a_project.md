# Getting started: How can you add work and materials to a project?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692445269521)

 

You have different ways to add internal costs and materials:

- Internal costs are added via the different methods of [time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) in Teamleader Focus. Read all about setting up the internal cost of your employees [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695715407761-How-To-Define-the-internal-cost-of-your-employees).

- Materials could be articles, rent for a venue, or also travelling costs, depending on your kind of project. Add these via the work breakdown on a project. Find more information [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695560896145-How-To-Add-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

In our example project, we would have quite some materials, such as all building material or all the needed machinery. Internal costs would be the time we spend on research or meetings.
