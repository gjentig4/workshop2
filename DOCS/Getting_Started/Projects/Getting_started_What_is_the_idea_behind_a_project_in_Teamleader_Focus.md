# Getting started: What is the idea behind a project in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692408350865)

 

Projects could basically be about anything: from building a new house, to setting up a new marketing campaign or building a new website from scratch.

 

In Teamleader Focus, a project could be the next step once a deal is accepted: the actions you take to live up to what you promised to do in your quotation, but it could also be an internal project.

 

A project grants you the option to easily add tasks and meetings while keeping an overview of the overall progress. The work breakdown on a project allows you to make clear estimates of the required work per project group and allows you to keep your projects perfectly under control. There's also the resource planning, which lets you spread the workload within just a few clicks. 

 

On a project, you can also monitor the use of the allocated budget. Navigate to the project and click on the tab 'Project info'. On this page, you'll find 'Budget spent'. **'Budget spent' on a project** displays your customer's budget and how much billable hours are spent. Budget management on projects is a way to keep track of the predetermined budget you and your customer have agreed upon. By allocating resources and estimating time on billable tasks & meetings, you'll know if you are going over budget. Besides that, you can also visualise the **margin **by giving an overview of the costs you've incurred in relation to the revenue (price) of the project. 

 

Furthermore, you will be able to draw up detailed timesheets reports of each project.

 

To make things clearer, let's run through an example together in the next article (building a house).
