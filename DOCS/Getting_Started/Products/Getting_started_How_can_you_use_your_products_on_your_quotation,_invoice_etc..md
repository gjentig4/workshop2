Within the quotation or the invoice you can either search on name or ID to add products. Read [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691970559761-How-To-How-can-I-add-hide-the-ID-of-my-products-on-quotations-invoices-etc) in case you want to hide the ID on your documents.
