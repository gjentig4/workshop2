- *What information do you need to add to your products?*

- *How do you want to structure your database?*

 

Products in Teamleader Focus do not necessarily mean products in a traditional sense. Even if you do not offer goods but services, it is still advisable to add those services as[ products](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692618041233-How-To-Importing-products-into-Teamleader-Focus). This facilitates the creation of quotations and invoices as you do not have to fill in the name and the price per unit repeatedly. You can even add [units](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691458413201-FAQ-How-can-I-add-units-to-my-products),[ long descriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691386604177-FAQ-How-can-I-add-a-long-description-to-a-product) or[ translations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690901801105-How-To-Using-products-in-another-language-on-a-quotation-invoice) which are added automatically as well.

Concerning the structure of your database - yes, structure, I hear your cheering already - you can always add additional information via[ custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus) on[ product level](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692101619217-FAQ-What-do-the-settings-of-a-custom-field-stand-for), which can also be completed via an import.

Additionally we offer a basic[ stock management](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691712397713-How-To-Stock-management-in-Teamleader-Focus) function so that you can always see how many cables, lipsticks or cups you still have.
