# Getting started: How can you obtain reports on tracked time?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692465266961)

- *Which time tracking overviews are available?*

- *Who should have access to this overview?*

 

If you want to work with exports, insights and targets, it's important to let your colleagues know, so they use the different ways to track time. This will help you deliver a clear and realistic timesheet, in order to know exactly who did what when - you get the picture.

 

In terms of reporting, Teamleader Focus offers the option to send a daily [HR report](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691716494225-How-To-Exporting-reports-from-Teamleader-Focus) to admin users. He or she can also export reports per user via Timesheets > Export, and a general overview via **Settings **> **Users **> "View report". By default, every Teamleader Focus user has access to timesheets of all members on one team, while admin users have access to all timesheets.

 

Also, you'll be able to access certain stats via **Insights > Time Tracking**. An example would be the different performances per user or work type. Along with these stats, you'll also have the option to create [targets for time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691312824465-How-To-Adding-Targets), e.g. calls.

 

Admin users also have the option to freeze time tracking after a certain time. This way you can prevent colleagues from adding time tracking on dates longer than X amount of days ago, or changing existing time tracking manually after X days. This can be done by navigating to **Settings **> **Time Tracking **> Preferences. That's it; you're all set for timesheets.
