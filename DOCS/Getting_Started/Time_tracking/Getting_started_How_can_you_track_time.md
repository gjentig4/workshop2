Teamleader Focus offers various ways to[ track time](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus), e.g. time tracking on[ tasks](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691951764497-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-task-in-Teamleader-Focus),[ calls](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691945976209-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-call-in-Teamleader-Focus),[ meetings](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691976258193-FAQ-How-do-I-add-a-meeting-in-Teamleader-Focus) and tickets. It is also possible to[ track time for another Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691666760337-FAQ-Can-I-track-time-for-another-Teamleader-Focus-user) user, in case you want to assign this responsibility to one person. Another feature is our [weekly time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693832046865-How-To-Weekly-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus), allowing you to add multiple time trackings at once.

 

It's important to sit together with your team to find out the best way for your business. One of the basic decisions you'll need to take, is whether it's important to know who completes a task or which task is performed, as the [different kinds of hourly rates](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691956252177-How-To-Setting-different-types-of-hourly-rates) have an influence on the price per hour and thus, also on the amount you can invoice to your customer.

 

An interesting point could be that tracked time from your previous system can also be[ imported to Teamleader Focus](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691706103569-How-To-Importing-time-tracking-into-Teamleader-Focus).
