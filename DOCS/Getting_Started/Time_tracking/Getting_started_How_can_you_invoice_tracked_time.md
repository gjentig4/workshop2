# Getting started: How can you invoice tracked time?

![A 'LET'S START' introductory banner with a paper plane illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691002060177)

- *Should time tracking be invoiced?*

- *Does everything need to be invoiced?*

- *How do you want to invoice?*

 

By default, all time tracking is set as "billable". You'll need to set this as non-billable in case you don't want to invoice this time tracking to your customer. Additionally, there is an option under **Settings **> **Time Tracking **> **Preferences **to set the time tracking on 'non-billable' by default. This is something you should discuss internally: are more time trackings billable or non-billable? Do you want to enable this toggle by default?

 

After having filled up your timesheets, it is quite likely that you want to start creating the invoice. Check [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691017896081-How-To-Invoicing-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) how you can get started on that.
