# Getting started: What is included in my trial?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/41150090543633)
**Do I get access to all features during my free trial?**

Yes, you have access to all features during your trial. When you start your trial, we tailor your setup based on the answers you provide. This ensures you begin with the package and features that best match your needs.
During the trial, you can still switch to a different package, activate or deactivate boosters, and explore all available features.
 

**Are Boosters included in my free trial?**

Yes, all Boosters are included in your trial. We recommend the most relevant boosters during your trial setup, but you remain in full control. Throughout the trial, you can freely add or remove boosters to test what works best for your business.

These are all the Boosters that are included in your free trial:
