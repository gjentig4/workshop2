# Getting started: What are the different ways to create an invoice?

*E-invoicing is set to become mandatory in all European countries by 2030.*
*For Belgium, e-invoicing already became mandatory on 01/01/2026.** Find out all about e-invoicing and enabling **Peppol ***[*here *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693204310673-How-To-What-is-e-invoicing-and-how-do-I-enable-Peppol-in-Teamleader-Focus)*or *[*set it up in Teamleader Focus.*](https://focus.teamleader.eu/settings.php#company_information)

*H**ow do you want to invoice?*

 

In Teamleader Focus, there are several ways to invoice your products and services. But you'll need to be clear on your workflow once you've won the deal, and discuss this internally. This will allow you to make optimal use of Teamleader Focus right from the start.

 

Before you completely lose yourself in the maze of invoicing options, it may come in handy to create or [import some products](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692618041233-How-To-Importing-products-into-Teamleader-Focus). Even if you don't sell products in a classical sense, we'd advise you to add services or products, as you can then add [long descriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691386604177-FAQ-How-can-I-add-a-long-description-to-a-product) and [translations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690901801105-How-To-Using-products-in-another-language-on-a-quotation-invoice) to them. This will definitely save you some time when creating the actual invoice.

 

For more information, be sure to read "[Getting started with: Products](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/sections/24833883025425)". Moving on to the different ways to create an invoice:

 

## Invoice from scratch

You can create an invoice from scratch by navigating to **Revenue **> **Invoices **> **Add invoice **or - on the detail page of a contact/company - by clicking the plus sign in the menu bar at the top of your screen. Do note that you can only add products to an invoice based on tracked time, you cannot add time tracking to an invoice created from scratch.

## Invoice via deal or quotation

### Invoice via your quotation

Navigate to your accepted quotation in the **Quotations **module and click on the **Convert to invoice **button in the header.
![The header and action bar of a sent quotation in Teamleader Focus with a 'Convert to invoice' button.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692458969745)
 

### Invoice via your deal

Navigate to [your deal page](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page) and click on the **plus icon > ****Invoice **next to 'Follow up on your deal' to convert a won deal or an accepted quotation into an invoice. It's not needed to first create a quotation, but if you create a quotation first, the contents of your quotation will be copied to the invoice. Afterwards, the content of the invoice can still be altered of course.

The advantage? You'll now have the link between the deal and the invoice. #WorkSmarter

*Note: You cannot link an invoice to a quotation/deal after creation of the invoice, they can only be linked when you create the invoice from the deal/quotation directly. *

 

### Add products/time tracking to invoice

When creating the invoice out of the deal/quotation you can still add additional products, but note that it's not possible to add time tracking to an invoice based on products. When creating an invoice out of a deal/quotation, you also have the option to split up payments and create an [advance invoice](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690851648785-How-To-Creating-advance-invoices-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

### Link invoice from quotation to project

After creating an invoice from a deal/quotation you can optionally link it to an already existing project. Follow these steps:

- In the invoice, click on the **three dots **next to 'Info'.

- Click on **Change customer.**

- Fill out the **project** field.

- Click on **Save**.

- In the project, there will be a link to both your deal and your invoice.

 

## Invoice a project 

For this option, we advise you to read [How To: Invoice a project.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25695672586001-How-To-Invoice-a-project-in-Teamleader-Focus)

 

## 
[Invoice time tracking](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691017896081-How-To-Invoicing-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) 

*(This feature is not available in *[*Go *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)*or *[*Smart*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)*)*

 

You can also [track time](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) and create invoices based on tracked time. You have two options to do so:

- You invoice the tracked time via the contact/the company itself by navigating to the specific contact/company and by clicking "Actions" > "Unbilled time spent" > "Create invoice".
You can find an overview of the total amount to be invoiced per contact or company by navigating to the contacts or companies overview and adding the column 'Total to be invoiced' to the overview via the cogwheel in the bottom right-hand corner.

- You can also navigate to the invoice overview and click on **Invoice unbilled time **in the top right-hand corner.
![Action buttons for Invoices: Export, Invoice unbilled time, and Add Invoice.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692486133905)

You can then still edit that invoice and add products, etc. The positions on the invoice are merged based on the type of time tracking: calls, meetings, tasks based on work types. As soon as you create an invoice based on time tracking, a [time tracking report](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691716494225-How-To-Exporting-reports-from-Teamleader-Focus) will be created automatically. This report gives you a more detailed overview - that you can also add to your invoice as you send it to a customer.

 

Do note that you can only add products to an invoice based on time tracking, you cannot add time tracking to an invoice based on products.

 

## [Recurring invoices](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691389220881-How-To-Creating-a-subscription-in-Teamleader-Focus)

*(This feature is not available in *[*Go *](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693692738705-Our-GO-package)*or *[*Smart*](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696098299537-Features-per-package-SMART-GROW-FLOW)*)*

 

You can also [create subscriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691389220881-How-To-Creating-a-subscription-in-Teamleader-Focus) in Teamleader Focus in case you have recurring invoices. These can even be created from a deal right away if you set the cost type to recurring on your quotation. This way, you won't forget to invoice your customer - as invoices will be created automatically. You can even choose to create a task automatically once a subscription is renewed by navigating to **Settings **> **Revenue **> **Preferences**. And finally, you can choose to book those invoices and [send them automatically](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691807856785-FAQ-Can-invoices-from-subscriptions-be-sent-automatically). Other options include [direct debit](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692319531281-How-To-Direct-debit-in-Teamleader-Focus) and [merging invoices from subscriptions](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691412300049-FAQ-Can-I-combine-invoices-of-different-subscriptions-for-one-customer).
