# Getting started: How do you want your customer to accept a quotation and what are the steps after that?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692382254737)

 

After creating one or [multiple quotations](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693685516433-How-To-Multiple-quotations-in-Teamleader-Focus), your lead now only needs to accept one of them. Piece of cake, we’d say.

 

First, you need to decide whether you'd like to use [CloudSign](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign) or paper versions. When sending your quotations via email, you can create an[ email template](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691228260881-How-To-Email-templates-for-quotations-invoices-and-meetings) via settings to save time, as you do not want to draw up the same email over and over again.

 

You can manually mark a quotation as “**Accepted**”, but you can also use [CloudSign](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690878232593-How-To-Digital-signing-of-your-quotations-with-CloudSign). This enables your customers to view their quotations online and sign them right there on the spot. Teamleader Focus will then change the deal status of the linked deal automatically to “**Won**”. Woohoo! Because customers can already access the quotation(s) via CloudSign, we advise you to leave out the pdf version of the quotation in your email.

 

The next steps depend on your process:

- Do you want to convert a quotation into an invoice?

In case the quotation wasn't accepted and your linked deal is lost, you can fall back on the loss reasons you can define in **Settings > Deals and Quotations**. The difference between a lost deal and deleting a deal is explained in [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692126037521-FAQ-What-is-the-difference-between-a-lost-deal-and-a-deleted-deal).
