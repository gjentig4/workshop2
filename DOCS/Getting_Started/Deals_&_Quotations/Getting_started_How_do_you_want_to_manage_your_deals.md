# Getting started: How do you want to manage your deals?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692380041233)

 

- *What information do you want to add to your deal?*

- *What reporting of your deal is needed?*

- *Who should have access to it?*

 

The first question is an interesting and important one, as it is not useful to just copy all information from a company in a deal. You need to decide **which information** is necessary in your CRM and which information is needed in the deal.

 

This is important for two reasons:

 

- First, repeating information creates a chaotic view, and [since the overview of your deals for a certain customer is shown within the company/contact level](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page), also not needed.

- Second, depending on the information saved within the module, you can create[ segments](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus) in the deal overview. In order to add additional information to your deal, you need to create[ custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus) under settings on[ deal level](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692101619217-FAQ-What-do-the-settings-of-a-custom-field-stand-for).

 

Also important is deciding to which [sales pipeline](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25696017218705-How-To-Multiple-Sales-Pipelines-in-Teamleader-Focus) you want to add the deal, because If your company sells different products or services or has many sales teams and company entities, you will have different workflows.

 

After you've created a deal you can consult it in detail via the **deal page**, which you can read about [here](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697814636305-How-To-Deal-overview-per-customer-and-deal-page).

 

Two pieces of information worth discussing are the **deal sources** and the **deal loss reasons**. We advise you to agree upon a small selection of deal sources and deal loss reasons for two reasons. First, I suppose you guessed it already, you can create segments based on them, and second, Teamleader Focus provides stats on this topic under **Insights **> **Deals**.

 

Another interesting asset for a deal is the **probability rate**. The deal forecast calculations rely heavily on the probability rate of your deals. [Check this article to learn more about the deal forecast.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25697739813521-How-To-The-deal-forecast-in-Teamleader-Focus) 

 

Under Insights, you’ll find extensive reports on deals such as deal cycle length or your yearly sales performance. Customise your reports further by filtering the results by deal pipeline or assignee, or adapt the time frame.

It might be possible that you want to[ limit the deal access](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691455806993-FAQ-What-does-limited-deal-access-mean), as not every sales talent should see all deals. This limitation is based on the responsible person of a deal.
