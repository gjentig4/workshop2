# Getting started: How do you want to manage your calendar?

![A 'LET'S START' introductory banner with a paper plane illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691002060177)

- *Should everyone be able to see everything?*

- *How can you follow up performances?*

You can determine [who should be able to see which calendar](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691555792401-FAQ-Why-can-t-I-see-the-calendar-of-my-colleagues) under **Settings **> **Users**. Make sure you decide who should be able to access what well in advance. The actions performed by each colleague are saved under the [Timesheets](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690664746001-How-To-Time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) section, which also offers the option to draw up [reports](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691716494225-How-To-Exporting-reports-from-Teamleader-Focus).

 

The main difference between the Agenda section and the Timesheets section is the timeframe. In your agenda, you'll see everything that still needs to be done by you and your colleagues. In timesheets, you'll see what has been done by you and your colleagues. 

 

Additional ways to follow up on colleagues are [meeting reports](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692057110801-FAQ-Can-I-create-a-meeting-report) and[ targets](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691312824465-How-To-Adding-Targets).
