Once you've mastered Teamleader Focus, it's crucial to get the rest of the team on board. Only then you will get the most out of the tool.

 

# Tips and tricks 

 

## Avoid ambiguities

Digitalisation brings about change and questions. It is important to communicate the purpose and added value of digitalisation to your team. Organise a team meeting, make sure that the questions of your team are resolved and that all ambiguities are removed.

 

## Make it easy on your team and yourself

During your daily tasks you don't want to be teaching all the time and your team doesn't want to feel like a student all the time. Make your team aware of the resources Teamleader Focus has.
