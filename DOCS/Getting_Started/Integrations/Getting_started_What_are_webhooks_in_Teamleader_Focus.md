# Getting started: What are webhooks in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691095882257)

 

A Webhook is an advanced feature and it’s recommended for users familiar with custom coding.

 

Webhooks are an easy way to receive real-time push-notifications about events in Teamleader Focus. A [webhook ](https://developer.teamleader.eu/#/reference/other/webhooks)works as a reverse [API](https://developer.teamleader.eu/#_ga=2.154767281.862457319.1530024383-1293655958.1528116603). Instead of making a call to the API, you can define a URL in Teamleader Focus were the call is sent to. This call itself is a simple HTTP request with some POST parameters. The POST parameters make it clear what the event means. Next you can process your own business logic based on the event.

 

We do want to emphasize though that we will not develop a custom solution for you. In case you need more extensive support, then we recommend some of our partners, who are happy to help. Just write an email to partner@teamleader.be.
