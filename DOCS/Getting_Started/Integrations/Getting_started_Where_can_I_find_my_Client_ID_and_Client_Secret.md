# Getting started: Where can I find my Client ID and Client Secret?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/36318091739921) 

To obtain your *Client ID *and the *Client Secret* you will need to go to our Marketplace, and [create a new test integration](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/eu/en/build). In 'Oauth2 Credentials' you'll find the information you need in 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret'.

Now copy the Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect URL in Insomnia OAuth2 or another API client.

 

More details about all of this can be found [here](https://developer.focus.teamleader.eu/docs/authentication).
