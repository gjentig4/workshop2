## What exactly is the Marketplace?

The [Teamleader Focus Marketplace](https://marketplace.teamleader.eu/be/en) is a central platform that allows you to browse through all available integrations with Teamleader Focus.

 

Stay on top of your schedule by linking your Outlook account to track mails and by connecting your Google calendar to your Teamleader Focus planning, keep in touch with your contacts through our integration with Mailchimp for email marketing, take care of your accounting with one of our two-way bookkeeping integrations. You name it; the goal is to centralize as much of your business activities as possible.

 

## How to navigate in the Marketplace

To access the marketplace, just click your icon user in the top right hand corner of your account, and click on **‘Integrations/Marketplace’**.
