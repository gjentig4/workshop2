# Getting started: Migrating towards API v2

![A 'LET'S START' introductory banner with a paper plane illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691002060177)

*The following article provides additional background information about the final migration to our current API version, referred to as 'API v2' in this article. This information is primarily relevant for customers who are still using older integrations relying on the previous API version, referred to as 'API v1' here.*

## Context

A few years ago, we introduced API v2, a robust and advanced version of our previous API, designed to enhance your integration capabilities with Teamleader Focus. Since the introduction of API v2, API v1 has **not been publicly available anymore**. However, to support older integrations, **we continued to allow the use of API v1 until API v2 included the same functionalities**.

We are pleased to announce that API v2 is about to entirely replace API v1. Our dedicated development team has actively worked on addressing any limitations, ensuring that API v2 offers the same functionalities as its predecessor.

## Deprecation of API v1: August 1, 2024

To streamline our services and maintain a consistent integration experience, **we will discontinue API v1 on August 1, 2024**. This decision aims to ensure that all integrations benefit from the enhanced capabilities of API v2.

*Note that we will transition into an active deprecation mode on June 1st 2024, where you will only be able to **fetch** data via API v1, rather than add, delete or update existing data. *

## What actions can you take?

If you are still using API v1 functionality, the admin users of your account will receive multiple notifications from us between October 2023 and August 2024. The majority of API v1 users can already switch to API v2 without losing functionality. Others will need to wait until the missing endpoints are developed (expected by February 2024 at the latest).

**Here are the steps you can take to prepare for the migration to API v2:**

### Notify your developer:

If you have an external integrator or a team managing your Teamleader Focus integration and you have received an email from us, please inform them about this update. It is crucial for them to be aware of these changes for a smooth transition.

### Prepare for transition:

We encourage you to explore API v2 immediately. [You can find its documentation here](https://developer.focus.teamleader.eu/).

### Stay informed:

For the latest updates on specific endpoints and features, please regularly check [our API v2 Roadmap](https://developer.focus.teamleader.eu/#/introduction/api-evolution). We will continue updating this resource as new endpoints are added. By February 2024, the final endpoints should be developed.
