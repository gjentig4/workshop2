# Getting started: What is API in Teamleader Focus?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692822264721)

The Teamleader Focus API is designed for developers, engineers, or anyone else who’s comfortable creating custom-coded solutions or integrating with APIs. 

 

## API documentation

Do you want to start using our API? [Here ](https://developer.focus.teamleader.eu/)you can find all the necessary documentation, including the available endpoints.

Do you have any questions about the available endpoints or is something not completely clear to you? Don't hesitate to reach out to us via api@teamleader.eu and give as much info as possible. Please answer the following questions, which will allow us to investigate the issue and help you.

- What are you trying to do?

- Which endpoint do you use?

- Please give an example of the body / of the request (JSON)?

- Which error message did you receive ?

We do want to emphasise though that we will not develop a custom solution for you. In case you need more extensive support, then we recommend some of our partners, who are happy to help. Just write an email to partner@teamleader.be and give us some more info about what you'd like to achieve.

 

## Your own API integration

If you'd like to create your own integration, it's possible to have a separate test account. If you'd like to have one, please reach out to us via [api@teamleader.eu](mailto:api@teamleader.eu) so we can tell you how to proceed.

Are you ready to start testing your API calls, have a look at [this article](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693133999633-Getting-started-How-can-I-test-my-API-V2-integration) for more info.

Did everything go well? Then it's now time to [add the integration to your Teamleader Focus account](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690984039441-Getting-started-How-do-I-add-an-integration-to-my-Teamleader-Focus-account).

Would you like to give other customers the chance to use your integration? In that case, you [publish your integration](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692187820561-Getting-started-How-do-I-publish-my-integration-on-the-Teamleader-Focus-Marketplace) via [our Marketplace](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692762887441-Getting-started-The-Teamleader-Focus-Marketplace).

 

**Important remarks:**

- Pay attention that you always use the type 'post'.

- Our API examples are in php. However, our API is not specific to php, .net and .php are similar and will follow the same principles.
