# Getting started: Integrations

![A 'LET'S START' introductory banner with a paper plane illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691002060177)

 

This article is a bit different from the others, as the integrations do not need to be set up in a certain workflow. However, you will find out what integrations Teamleader Focus offers and how they need to be set up. Generally, Teamleader Focus differs between integrations on user level and integrations on account level.

 

Do stay tuned, because we continuously extend our list of integrations.

 

## For all integrations on account level, you need to be an [admin](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691974365841-FAQ-What-are-the-rights-of-an-admin) in order to set the link:
