# Getting started: What data can I import?

![A 'LET'S START' introductory banner with a paper plane illustration on a light blue background.](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25691002060177)

 

*Before you started using Teamleader **Focus**, you probably already collected plenty of documents and other data; invoices, ongoing deals, timesheets, etc. Instead of losing time importing them manually, most of these can be imported into your Teamleader Focus account via bulk actions.*

 

To do an import, you'll need an Excel or CSV-file. Fair enough, but what data can be imported? By whom? And what are the requirements for the file itself? You'll find out in the table below.

 

The table lets you know:

- Whether a certain module can be imported via Teamleader Focus or via the API

- Whether the import can only generate new items or also update existing ones
If the import can't update existing items, then it's still possible to manually change imported items afterwards

- Who executes the import: our Support-team, the customer or a partner

- What fields the import file can & should contain
