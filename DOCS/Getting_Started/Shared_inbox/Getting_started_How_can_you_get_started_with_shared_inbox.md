# Getting started: How can you get started with shared inbox?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692557219089)

 

In order to get started, you need to [set up your shared inbox](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691088759057-How-To-Using-tickets-in-Teamleader-Focus) and[ forward your emails to the shared inbox](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691359158545-FAQ-How-do-I-forward-emails-to-the-shared-inbox-in-Teamleader-Focus). In Teamleader Focus there are three[ ways to create a ticket](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691499281681-How-To-3-ways-to-create-a-ticket), so it is worth having a look which options might fit best in your daily schedule. The advantages of using shared inbox is that the tickets offer a direct link to a contact or a company in your CRM. If you need some further information within a ticket, you always have the option to create[ custom fields](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692628832017-How-To-Creating-a-custom-field-in-Teamleader-Focus).

 

When your shared inbox is set up, you can streamline your communication by answering your customer directly, adding an internal note to a colleague or forwarding it to a[ third party](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691629558801-How-To-Forwarding-a-ticket-to-a-third-party). All is possible and easy to be retrieved as everything is saved within one ticket. #WorkSmarter. The not-yet closed tickets can be found in your shared inbox, or in the detail page of the respective contact or company. The closed tickets are still available in your shared inbox and are mentioned in the activities of the respective contact or company.
