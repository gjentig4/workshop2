# Getting started: What reporting can you get of tickets?

![](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/article_attachments/25692567650449)

 

- *What stats are necessary?*

- *Do you want to invoice the time spent?*

 

In Teamleader Focus, it is possible [to track time on a ticket](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25693133292433-FAQ-Can-I-track-time-on-a-ticket) and also[ invoice it](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25691017896081-How-To-Invoicing-time-tracking-in-Teamleader-Focus) to your customer. This way, it is easy to keep the overview of the workload per email. However, Teamleader Focus also offers different ways of reporting on tickets: [shared inbox stats](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25692224156305-FAQ-What-information-do-the-shared-inbox-stats-provide) and[ segments](https://support.focus.teamleader.eu/hc/en-150/articles/25690816108305-How-To-Creating-a-segment-in-Teamleader-Focus) on ticket level.
